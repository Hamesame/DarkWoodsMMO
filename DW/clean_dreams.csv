0," Nightmare in Cambodia. In the dream we are being overrun by sappers who have got past the Night Defensive Perimeter trips and claymores and now crawl forward. I wake up and see a boot tread close to my face. I slowly withdraw my . from its holster, pull the hammer back, then aim it at the boot. Just then the cloud-obscured moon comes out and I realize the boot is American and that it is Jerry Bieck's foot. In the pitch stillness I point the . straight up in the air. Pinching the hammer tightly I pull the trigger and settle the hammer back in place. I re-holster the pistol and go back to sleep. The next day, after a very difficult march, all the men are overjoyed to be out of Cambodia. I tell no one what almost happened."
1," The enemy is above, in the sky. We are not soldiers but school children. A voice from everywhere begins to warn us, ""Things are dropping."" Seed begin to fall. Then I hear the faint echo of the tubes popping. There is an underground bunker; most of us run for the school bus. The mortars are dropping close by, within twenty yards. The fear of realizing death is pacing through my mind. We are all crowded in, scared of a hit. I shield my face with two paperback books. All at once there is a sharp explosion. I am hit, though I scream for only a moment. It is such a helpless feeling. The concussion has shattered the teeth in my mouth and I am going into shock. The dream ends here."
2," We are on a firebase. It is night time. In the distance a flare goes off. Someone says the intelligence reports indicate we may soon be attacked. I go into a bunker and search for my aid bag  full of  'bandages. There are none around. I decide to make a search before it is too late. In the dream, I am in a house; all of a sudden mortars begin to drop, close and very loud, and profusely, I remember feeling guilty, the house can withstand practically anything, but I am still terrified. The mortars drop endlessly. When it is all over, I run out. My entire platoon, fifteen men, are all dead. They have been collected and sit in a grotesque formation of the dead. The dream becomes unclear at this point."
3," We are on an LZ; I am. saying good bye to an American girl. We are embracing. Her father, dressed like, a Navy admiral, appears quite suddenly; for a moment. I address myself to him. He brings up the subject of security and somehow mentions the name of Crazy Frank . Suddenly everyone drops, we wait expecting the inevitable machine gun chatter etc., but it is only a false alarm. There are many soldiers spread about in not typical fashion, it appears more like a WWII beach scene than one of.an LZ in Vietnam. A colored soldier rises up and makes an unclear remark. Apparently someone inadvertently set off a chain reaction, all of us obeying the instinct acquired from contact. The commander and I resume talk, we parley for a few more minutes; this time there is no mistake. I hear the sounds of mortars popping from tubes. I look at the commander and say, ""Mortars , run for the bunkers."" A mad rush for cover follows. In my mind I am counting off  seconds even as I am running; this is how much time I anticipate we have. There seems to be an air of complete disregard for everyone but one's self. The commander pulls and tries to get past me; I myself have completely forgotten the girl. The bunker seems familiar, as from another dream. It is too large to be representative of the ones I sought refuge in while in Nam. When I am just inside, mortars begin to drop, I make for a sturdy wall; the sounds, of explosions seem to be coming right over us. I seem to sense that this bunker is more like the basement of a large house, and that the mortars are hitting the building structure above us. The explosions have become deafening. In the last moments of the dream"" I am near an opening, I vaguely see the outside ground, for I am lower and must look up. A terrific whining descends over head; a shell is going to drop very near to us. The blast takes place right outside the opening. I am knocked a few feet by the concussion, but not seriously injured. Very close, a machine gun opens up; it is a light  cal. We are under a ground attack. I wake up, bathed in the sweat of nocturnal madness."
4," This time, it is not the popping of the tubes, but the whistling of the mortars themselves that alerts us. We run for the bunkers. They are not bunkers as such, but the cinder brick foundations to be seen during the early construction of a home. There is no roof, only a few pieces of lumber overhead; it is very, very open. The mortars begin to drop, I hear the explosions very clear. This part of the dream seemed the most real. I recall huddling in a corner, shifting positions, as I anticipate a direct hit amidst us. The mortars continue to fall."
5," Robert and myself seem to be part of an infantry company, the identity and location seem obscure. We sleep in canvas tents, which I conscientiously view as rather odd. The enemy is undoubtedly oriental, and it is at this point that I detach myself from my own person and either become another, or simply phase out and watch what follows, experiencing the drama vicariously, twofold it would seem, as this is all imagined. The enemy attacks and I become acutely aware of the feeling of being shot in the head. I am behind a wall of some kind, the danger of being hit is very great. In a fury I grab a silver object which seems to resemble an rpg, and hurl it towards the foes. It explodes and immediately the entire area is shrouded in flames, even I  is/am enveloped. This is how the dream ends. I awaken with the all-too-familiar feeling that I notice each time I have a dream that ends with my own death."
6," We are on patrol somewhere in Nam. It is not my old unit but the feelings are the same. We are, the infantry lurking in the jungle. As usual we are spread apart, perhaps  to  meters between each man. The foliage ahead grows less and less dense.; one can see · to  meters forward, it is somewhat like the better terrain we encountered in Tay Ninh. I anticipate an ambush; things are going too easily. Beyond the stillness of our own guarded movements I sense another. With the first starting shots I drop instinctively to the ground. These are not the familiar popping sounds of the AK, though nonetheless I have anticipated correctly, we are in contact. Those up front fire back, immediately killing two. Then from my position I see two or three heads begin to rise. I yell to the others, at the same time pointing the muzzle of my  in the enemy's direction and attempting to fire. The gun jams. Quickly I reload another magazine and pull the trigger. Again nothing, but the others have caught on and the enemy attack seems over. From the background I hear a sharp whining recoil; it is nothing like our  or . The number  flashes through my mind, though I am not sure if there is such a weapon; perhaps light weapons, but as the shells fall I realize they are undoubtedly heavy artillery. The first explosions fall outside our perimeter; they do not descend like mortars, nor do they explode like artillery. On impact there is a sharp thunder-clap, followed by earth-like clouds of swirling, thick and heavy dust; though it is curious, these manifestations are small and hug the ground. Soon the shells drop closer and' closer to us, and I hear the shrapnel whizzing over. Finally one lands almost on top of me and I imagine a large piece of steel penetrating the flesh of my back. There is no pain, but I realize this to be a death wound. The last moments of the dream are obscured by the dust clouds."
7," We are walking down a trail. Above and beyond I see a sort of rubber orchard  with dinks. Just as I spot this Clopton comes running past, dressed in white. He has been wounded in the arm. We gather about and form a defensive perimeter. A machine gun team of dinks stalks right up to us. It seems everyone is too scared to fire. I open up with three short bursts and literally rip the dink gunner in half. A while later, a single dink walks up to us, unmolested. I sense that no one is going to fire and spatter him wickedly with my M-. It is a good feeling, though I am worried about ammo. We retreat to a large building and cluster fuck within. It seems almost like the room I am living in now. Several of us flop onto the bed and crash. I recall thinking about pulling guard twice a night. It is a wonder that we get enough sleep. I am tempted to doze off but the fear of dinks breaking in prompts me to stay awake. Someone has the side door covered. I shift about, watching one door and then the next, expecting an attack any second. The dream becomes unclear at this point."
8," We are on a trail, a well-used trail. Any moment, I am ready for an ambush. It seems that / platoon is drag, as way up in front AK and  shots are exchanged. Oddly, at first no one dives to the ground. Instead, we look to see what has happened. Capt. Hyslop seems to be standing over a dead dink. Then hell breaks lose. The bamboo surroundings become a barren hilly expanse with dinks about us. They have some sort of modern building on a ledge  meters to my right. Way off I see a dink machine gunner beading on us. I open up on him. Then another dink MG appears, closer. I, too, have a machine gun, we will duel with bullets. Who will kill the other first? A dink on the ledge by the building hurls a grenade at me. I am lucky. It is a bit short of its target. I hug the earth and cannot recall being hurt. Next, the dink gunner rolls a base ball grenade towards me. I consider my chances against the time delay, grab it and hurl it a mighty length. It explodes harmlessly in the air. The duel renews. His bullets churn up staccato patterns of dust in front of me. I fire one long burst and catch him with one shot in the chest. He is dead. AK's blossom everywhere. It is like June , . I fear running out of ammo. In the dream I am with Larry Roy. We are by a conex filled with ammo. We deliberate what to do. The dream becomes unclear after this."
9," I am in a strange sort of bunker. The other day I had been going through an album of family pictures. The bunker is actually the bar in the basement of  Ivy Street! I am lying on the counter in a prone position; the atmosphere is one of war. Sandbags and timber abound. The sky is eerily overcast. Bombs begin to fall. Not the mortars of past dreams but rather some kind of heavy artillery. A sharp thunder follows the initial detonation, as if there were some sort of dual explosive, or perhaps a new barrage tactic. I throw myself over and fall to the ground. Cowering under the counter I wait for the inevitable. Within seconds a shell crashes down upon the spot I had occupied and not too hastily vacated. Debris flies; dirt clods and splinters of broken wood shower down. I recall the thought of being randomly lucky. The dream becomes unclear at this point."
10," We are on the same fire base as the one established in Cambodia. This time I am not with my own platoon but I am part of the TOC/CP. BC  Is none other than the young doctor from LZ Green who did not know how to handle his own rank. We meddle about in a huge canvas tent. I think about digging a fox hole but there are no shovels. Night comes. All of a sudden there is a metallic burst of illumination flares. The sky lights up and we are showered by the magnesium brightness. For the first few moments no one knows what is going on. Who has called for the lume? Then, through the thin canvas I see two figures run past about  yards off. So, it is a ground attack. But I say nothing. Moments later the AK's open up. In the dream there are several old house where the gooks have holed up. My old platoon and I converge on it. With my M- roaring I cut down several dinks. I am overwhelmed by the sight of two individuals fighting with the enemy. Of all people, there is Wilson, our old RTO. I begin to fire, but my M- is sluggish; the bullets dumbly chug out. Wilson is followed by Juba, my friend from down the street, a high school buddy . Juba has a long .. His long drilling shots come after Wilson sprays me with a burst that catches me flush across the body. Again, though I am obviously hit, nothing happens. The fire fight ends. We go back to the tent. I see bullet holes in my ankles. The Captain asks me if there is anything I want. I think of telling him, ""Yes! A Medivac,"" but I say only that we should dig fox holes. The next day I scrounge for ammo. There is little or none to be found, though I steal two grenades. I meet Roop and Melhop. During the fire fight, I use grenades but they prove ineffective. Even though I hold them for two or three seconds after the handle flies off  they are thrown too hard and bounce away, and oddly, explode in a mere crackle of sparks, the way smoke does when it first ignites. Steve Shack  and I go to the other side of the base. There is a small VN compound. Shack throws a grenade into a little wooden school house filled with children. It blows up and there are the horrific screams of the wounded. We walk down a trail. I am telling him how stupid he is for making this mess, surely there will be another attack tonight. Children come shrieking out and run after us. I turn and beckon to them. ""Come with me, come to me."" A jeep pulls up and takes on the casualties."
11," I have done something for a man who seems to be in some sort of trouble. I am somehow like a spy. I go with another person and we demand to be paid. In fact I am quite adamant. I say, ""You will pay me now!"" I am given a great sum of money. I am aware that others want to get me and take the money. Therefore, I must escape. I am running. I am found. The ones who seek me begin to shoot at me. I dive behind a big machine gun and fire back. A star of David, as if superimposed, descends upon this scene."
12," I am in a hostile land. There is a war going on. With two other men  I sit in a crude rock shelter that looks like this: . We are on high ground, overlooking a huge river. Between the three of us there is only one magazine of ammunition. Moments before, I had the opportunity to get more, but I did not take it. We are waiting, anticipating an ambush. Two Chinese come up the hill on horseback. One dismounts and comes right up to the open ports of the shelter. He has a samurai sword. I lunge my M - into his chest and pull the trigger. The sound is not the usual sharp staccato that I am used to. Instead, it is muffled and somewhat dull. The Chinaman hacks away at my arm and slashes it with his sword. But within moments-he dies."
13, In the dream I am a soldier flying a small balsa wood plane by telepathy. It crashes to the ground. Another solider sleeping nearby is wounded in the head. As I return to my living quarters I retell the incident to a group of soldiers that are following me. Two blacks become greatly excited. One takes out his pistol and wags it carelessly. I am shot in the thigh. I think of the dull pain that begins to throb. The blood begins to gush from my femoral artery. I wonder where I can find a tourniquet. I wake up.
14," I am in Basic Training in the Army. A Drill Sergeant upbraids me. I beat and pummel him until he is dead. I go to Vietnam. I am with my old company but I am not accepted. I become a loner, an outcast. Roaming about, I shoot down American helicopters. At one point a Chinook lands and G.I.'s new to Vietnam come out and begin to march in single file. I shoot at them but instead of bullets only a spray of water falls on them."
15," I am with a friend. We have traveled to a strange land. The people resemble the “pineys” of the Pine Barrens . They are very kind and friendly; they share food and drink with us. I am easily at home with them. They present me with many small gifts. I am perched up on a high ledge. An old college English teacher is to read one of David Boyle's poems. He  asks that he may read it himself It is written in a very simple hieroglyphic form. There are crows and hawks and their feet markings: . As he reads I become emotionally aroused. Moments later I am openly weeping. I return to this land with my old platoon. Everything has changed. The land has been scorched; nothing remains from the joyous past. I begin to load my M- but it is with the new and unfamiliar banana clip. We are ambushed. I squeeze off a few rounds before scampering for cover. I lose sight of my platoon. They patrol without me, the only medic. A sense of great overwhelming guilt follows. We relink later. I am ashamed of myself, but I am glad to see that the others are all safe. The Lieutenant is somewhat stern with me. The shame passes."
16," There are several of us smoking dope in a small park surrounded by barbed and wire fences. Among those that I recognize there is John, David and Larry Williams, a Sgt. From Vietnam. From the corner of my eye I see the police. They charge up to us at a gallop and we are all busted. One fellow that I do not recognize makes a dash for it. He vaults the fence and heads for the woods. As the dogs are set after him I think that it is an impossible situation. As it happens, the fellow runs quickly and makes good his escape. We are herded to a jail in India. There are many rooms here, but they are small and cramped; the bars are quite thick. I think over and over to myself, as if the dream were real, ""This can't be happening to me, to me!"" But it is all too true; I am locked up. A turnkey opens a cell and allows David to leave. The jailer next turns to me and offers freedom if I will inform on the others. I think to myself, ""This is only a trick. Besides, I cannot betray my friends."" I anguish in the little cell. The dream ends."
17," I am again led to a prison. The black man in front of me kisses the jailers hand. I walk past, then turn around and do the same. The gesture is followed by submissive talk, that he will be as on me. I escape. There is a cave from which come holy sounds. The shadows of animals run across its walls. I am flying through rock, then thick, lava like water, then water. I see a piece of rope and with both hands reach for it. My head clears the water and I see that I am in a beautiful lake. Still clinging to the rope I am / my normal size. I have been hoisted up by a child, a little girl of perhaps seven."
18," I am in a large classroom. The teacher is taking roll. He calls, ""Veterans."" No one answers. A second time the name is called. I trumpet out, ""Don't you know that's me, you big baboon!"" Everyone in the class begins to laugh. Even the teacher, who resembles the plastic surgeon Dr. DeStefanol, breaks into a grin. The laughter, instead of subsiding, grows and grows, until it is followed by loud and sustained applause. Everyone is smiling, everyone is applauding, everyone is cheering. These people are all familiar to me, they are from my past. Here, they are depicted as children. The pitch grows higher. I am born aloft by the many hands and arms of the great crowd and deposited at the head of the class, alongside the teacher. There are four pretty girls with us. I remember thinking, ""He is overweight, but does not look like a baboon."" Recollection ends here."
19," I am with my old unit in Vietnam. The order comes over the radio that we are now finished with jungle patrols. The Lieutenant makes it official and we silently begin to disband. Suddenly, a civilian, an older man in a suit, emerges from a tent. He speaks to us. ""If my son can't go, no one goes."" Then he shoots and kills my good friend Jerry Bieck. I am overwhelmed and unload several shots at him. Nothing happens. Then, with an unusually long burst of automatic from my M- I cut him down. As the others have walked off, I throw the gun down and follow after them. There is a feeling of complete freedom. In very high spirits Jim Lamb and I go to a supermarket and buy food. I am aware that I do not wear my steel helmet. The dream is repeated. This time I do the killing with a laser beam. The man is this time Parrish, a medic from another company I did not like. He dies a slow and agonizing death."
20," I am in a large empty house. My brother and I are dressed as soldiers; we are hunting each other. I see him before he spots me and hit him with a burst of . I walk the bullets up to him. Curiously, they make only a small BB pattern and noise. There is little impact, little of the expected striking force. In any event, he goes down and I immediately rush to his aid. I feel very sorry for him and for what I have done."
21," There is a war going on between the Americans and what appear to be either Germans or Russians. The battle ground resembles the trench warfare of World War I. The land between the two sides reminds me of the no-man's-land of LZ Ranch in Cambodia. Each side is firing artillery, adjusting for accuracy. The shells fly back and forth and fall with muffled dull thuds. Then the other side launches a ground attack. They throw hand grenades as they run. The grenades hit the ground and bounce forward. I catch one and hurl it back. Then another, then two more. The others  do the same. I am in hand to hand combat with a man of about fifty; he is fat and ruddy looking. With a sinister leer he taunts me. Twisting his knife through the air he is easily the more skillful. I am lightly scarred several times but somehow, as my knife becomes a fork, I spear him in the throat, causing him a mortal wound. His eyes bulge forward; the gushing blood mixes with his last gurgling breath."
22," My brother and I break into an Army base, having gotten past the guards. There are cases and cases of grenades stacked up. I open one and throw it. It explodes. Then we see my father in the distance. He beckons to us. As we go, I hurl missiles in his direction. They are like giant bullets, arching up, then falling and crashing down. We speak to him about flowers. He insists that cultivation  is no different from nature. My brother and I argue against my father. The scene changes. Looking out a window I can see I am very high off the ground. A man below is reading off winning numbers from some sort of lottery. Thousands of people are gathering. He has somehow angered them. I fall out the window but somehow survive the fall. Then a huge oblong plate of metal tumbles down and strikes me a glancing blow on the head. I think it is a death blow, as I am weak from loss of blood. I am weeping. My mother tries to comfort me. In between my sobbing I tell her to contact Peter Ahr  and with this message say, ""Tell David  I'm sorry."" Then, as it appears that the wound is not mortal, I suggest we go and get an x-ray."
23," I am back in Vietnam, We are on patrol. Bob and my brother are with me, My brother wears a camouflage T shirt, We tramp through the jungle until we reach a great clearing, It is a great sloping field, much like those in the Watchung Reservation, My brother goes around the side on a small recon. Two G.I.s already at the bottom of a hill mistake him for VC and direct fire at him, I hail them off, but it is too late. I see my brother being hit. Another GI from behind is also shooting at my brother. From fifty meters I hit him with a sustained burst from my M-. The bullets wind through the air, arcing like artillery shells. Bob grabs the fellow I have wounded while I go to the aid of my brother. We take them both to a nearby hospital which resembles my childhood grammar school. The doctor acts quickly, taking the wounded into the operating room, We go back, as there is nothing left for us to do, A fellow who I dislike intensely, another medic, sallies up on horseback from behind us and jeeringly announces that my brother is dead. I am heartbroken and begin weeping and sobbing, Then I turn around and with the strength that comes from great anger grab the horse by its throat and half wrestle it to the ground. My lamentations grow softer, until the mourning feeling is all but gone. As Bob and I return to the hospital we must cross a street. The area resembles the neighborhood of my childhood. A policeman halts an oncoming car that I have waited to let pass. The dream ends with an intense feeling of loss."
24," I am trying to squeeze into a small English sports car. It keeps moving and I say, ""Fuck You"" to the driver. He returns and challenges me to a fight. We are in the garage of Bob's parents. I am full of confidence and cunning. Outmaneuvering the other fellow, I stab him in the back with a knife and say, ""Give up or I'll kill you."" He yields and I help him outside and dress his wounds. "
25,". “To Fly or Not to Fly” I’m at a meditation meeting or something like that and I’m sitting together with one of the instructors a Spanish Italian kind man – he looks like Spanish or Italian. We are sitting up in a helicopter or a small airplane. At a certain time there seems to be another guy near the cockpit and I ask the instructor if he, the other guy, is a pilot. The instructor says no. Then there is an erotic atmosphere between me and the instructor, and I feel a bit insecure – is this suitable for a man like him and for me? But I really enjoy it – the connection with him. At the same time I think that I have to get it out of my head and go down and sit down in the hall somewhere on a chair, but now it actually seems as if this is a meeting outdoors. Well, anyhow, I have to keep my feelings low, and think that I could probably just give him my address. I have no doubt about what I want to do, but I’m insecure about the way he lives – how he lives – and if more contact with me will give him problems in some way because he’s this meditation instructor. He doesn’t worry at all. He’s very relaxed and he’s having his hand on my back and it’s a very close contact we have. Then things change and now I’m at work, and this is a day where two new colleagues started work and I should actually be at my office and say welcome to them. But for some reason I have been very busy and been away and now in the middle of the daytime I’m sitting one afternoon in a park. It’s a park with lakes like you would see in Rome or Copenhagen or other cities – Paris, too. In the park there’s an older coupe with a child. There’s a very easy going relaxed atmosphere and everybody has plenty of time. Suddenly we see a very big mulatto girl – very brown, sensual soft and powerful. And she comes flying. She flies very, very fast. And some small birds and big birds, too, are following after her and sort of sniff to her genitals in a way like flies can do if you lie there without clothes. She’s sort of just whisking them away with her hand once in a while. And then she’s flying as if she was just lying on her stomach and I say to the – I think it’s the man in this older couple - that I have heard that you can fly in this way, but I have never known that you actually could fly in this way. It’s an incredible sight and we agree on that. We are very surprised. So, later on I’m also in the park, but now it’s evening, as it is dark. I’m sitting on – people are sitting on the benches – and I’m a little insecure about finding my way home. And then suddenly I’m back in my office room and very friendly I say hello to the two colleagues and say I hope they will excuse that I have been away. And then we eat lunch together with the other people who are working in this office."
26," The dream takes place in Ivy Hill Park. I am in the Army and we are soon to go on patrol. Since it is getting dark I go out to collect some wood for the fire. David Boyle and I are lying prone in what appears to be a lake. Actually the water is only a few inches deep. He has some sort of explosive charges but no matches with which to light them. I become serious and tell him to keep his voice down and find the matches. At the same time I am aware that something is out of place. The water is not deep. Suddenly we are charged from our right flank. A group of ten or fifteen men with fixed bayonets sallies towards us. They appear to be Oriental, though at the last moment I see that it is all a sham. These are our own men. I have been the object of a great joke. Rolling on the ground, David and I howl with laughter. We begin to sing a popular song. Our harmony and rhythm are surprisingly good. "
27," I am in Viet Nam, in the midst of . These are not the primitively devastating  rockets of Quan Loi fame ; instead  scaled down ICBM's. They whoosh through  as if in slow motion like the outgoing 's  and LZ Ranch. I am running for cover, anticipating the  of the blast and the whizzing shrapnel. As the missiles.  I see the shrap and dive through a window  a subterranean room. I have taken a few pieces  in the sole of my boot and one or two small fragments in the arm . More rockets fall, pounding away; the sharp explosions  followed by blinding flashes of skittering light. At one and the same time I sense the overwhelming terror of a direct hit, and yet I have so far escaped the unyielding terror and panic that accompany such occasions. Then I am with my platoon and the Lieutenant informs me that I should not be ashamed of my cowardice. I am to be relieved and sent elsewhere. The others too act  no call for shame. But their  and remarks serve only to  my feelings of humiliation. "
28, I am on a small wooden dock by a lake. With a long carrot I taunt a giant snapping turtle. I hit him on the nose but never let him get a bite. Then he manages to clinch the carrot for a moment and I see what appears to be the length of his jaw and teeth. Then he half raises up and clinches the carrot more firmly. Here is what I saw: . I am terrified and am not sure what to do next. I only know that up until now I had not realized how big and powerful this turtle was. 
29," I am in a place that resembles Viet Nam. In this instance I am selecting some sort of hotel room. I am looking for a place that can take the impact of mortars and bullets. I am now in a war zone. It is as if I have returned to Vietnam. All the buildings in the previous part of the dream have been almost totally destroyed. There is always the chance of being attacked. Much of the landscape resembles Ivy Hill, where I grew up. I kill some people  with a burst from my . Then I wish to escape and make my way to a train that goes from Vietnam to Thailand. I get out but do not want to be caught for desertion. A fellow checks my I.D. He comes upon four stamps that I have in my wallet. They have been given to me by my mother. He asks why I still carry them. I offer him one, leaving me three. I return to Vietnam and the sense of danger is heightened. It is the sense of death and destruction that haunts me more so than a confrontation with VC or NVA. Then a friend and I decide to escape by car. He drives and I am aware how wide he is taking the turns. He does not really have an idea of where he is going. I am afraid that we are going to be ambushed as I see the familiar jungle that hides the enemy. I know only too well this paradox of beautiful jungle and the enemy waiting within. I wake up with feelings of immense anxiety."
30,". “Don’t Be Afraid” I have just arrived to Prague in Czechoslovakia and I’m together with another person – I think it’s a woman. And we are on our way in a car to the hotel. The road is rather winding and hilly and we are driving over bridges. Under the bridges, there are rivers with a rather strong current. Somewhere in the distance I can see cars that are driving on roads where there is water – there is water on the roads. There seems to have been some flooding from the river. It scares me a little but I soon forget it. Then we come to a kind of tunnel with water in it. Here we have to put off the motor and set the car in a neutral gear and close doors and windows. And then the river takes us and the car away with the current. And at a certain time, the wheels in the car are turning upside down. For me it’s both scary and exciting. Then we come out of the water tunnel again and the car is now driving in a normal way. We are now on a very, very big open square. The earth is some base color flax with small round spots. It could be some kind of marble. We are very excited and in high spirits and very relieved after this trip in the water tunnel and we are eating some food with a very happy feeling. The food seems to be some celery or corn or salad or things like that. While we are eating, we are looking out on this big square. The sun is shining now. Until now I have been with this other person but I never see the person in the dream. I just have a feeling it’s a woman. Now I’m alone at the hotel where there seems to be some problems with my room. After some time, a lady comes and takes me to room . This room seems to be a kind of gymnastic room with some wall hangings on the walls. Now some people try to make this room nice to stay in. They put in some shelves and some commercial stuff from a hairdresser/salon room. But now I tell this lady who showed me the room and now she is about forty and small and a little fat. I tell her that I really wouldn’t like to stay in that room. One of the reasons is that there are no windows. She tells me that she thought it was room number  I should have and not . Now I go down to the reception and I have some kind of a power struggle with a man at the reception. I tell him that I want another room. He tells me that I can’t have that – they don’t have other rooms. But I stick to my view and after some time I tell him that if he doesn’t give me another room with windows, I will write a letter to the Danish government when I come home and tell how I have been treated. Now he becomes insecure and he looks as if he’s starting to cry. He says, “just a moment,” and then he walks into another room. Soon after he comes back and he gives me some keys to the room . I think it’s number  because in the dream,  seems to be the opposite of , but of course if you take the - and you turn it around it’s -, so it’s . But never mind I have another room and everything is okay. In the dream I’m very surprised that I can find my way around at the hotel because in real life I’m really bad at that – I very easily get lost in streets and hotels and things like that. So, but in the dream it’s okay. Now I’m walking in Prague together with the lady from the hotel - the one who showed me the room  – and another lady I know, a former neighbor, a woman. We walk around in the town where there are no cars. The houses are beautiful white with blue turquoise ornaments and there are street entertainers who are dancing in a long row, holding each other’s hands and their faces are turned towards us. The lady from the hotel tells me that it has something to do with a newly built museum. I say that these street entertainers, I would really like to show them to my son. In the background we can see some spears and we can hear some gorillas – some sounds from the churches. And then suddenly we are walking on a gravel road  and in these mountains there are a lot of heather - red violet blooming heather. I say that it’s fantastic that you can find this kind of gravel roads  in a big city. While we are walking on this gravel roads in the mountain there are some geese running after us - like when I was a child and went through a farm on my way to school there was always some geese that ran after me and I was quite afraid of them at that time. Now in the dream I start running but I’m just a little afraid. Now we come to the end of the mountain where the mountain stops. The view is beautiful. You can see a lot of hills and mountains all covered with heather, this red violet color. The people I’m together with walk to the edge of our mountain and look down. I look down too, but it’s a sort of precipice, I think it is - they are far down and suddenly you just look down, so I get scared and I have to lie down in the heather. I don’t want to show the other people that I am afraid. On some other hills and mountains you can see people are having fun tumbling down these slopes and they are really having fun. But, I’m just lying in the heather and looking at it and I’m not showing that I’m actually afraid. The slope or precipice - there where the mountain ends and you look down is different at the mountain I’m at because it sort of goes out and then it goes in and so if you fall down here you don’t tumble down, you just fall down. And the other mountains I’m looking at it, there you can sort of roll down or fall down, not suddenly but smoothly. "
31," I seem to be the leader of a small group of young people. An odd looking fellow walks past us and makes some sort of remark. A few moments later four or five bandits approach us and blaze away with pistols. I yell ""No!"" But I am shot in the face. It is a mortal wound, and yet I do not die. Instead, I feel a huge hollow gash where the left side of my face has been blown away. I am on a wooden raft in a lake. A huge black man and I are fighting. We each have  bamboo fishing poles. His idea is to snag me with a hook. We use the poles as if we were adept Tai Chi push-sword players. We are both extremely good at directing and slipping touches. Then, without trying, I land a blow to his head and he tumbles into the water. He has lost ungracefully in front of a small group of people that have gathered on the banks to watch. Later on I ask his whereabouts, as he is the father of a ..... "
32," Half awake in the dream, I am in some sort of open foxhole. I look to my left and see two VC sappers crawling past. They have mortars and are dropping them on a position ahead of me. I know that I have to move slowly and then spring up and kill them . The friendly position is in front of me. I kill one fellow . The other fellow manages to break free and begins talking into a small radio. He seems to be an FO . He talks quickly, as if sensing he is to die soon. We grapple and he manages to stab me a few times. Then he too is dead. Just as this happens, something amazing occurs. The whole countryside goes up in fire. A gigantic conflagration, in twenty seconds hundreds and hundreds of yards of land are on fire. For a few moments I don't know if I've done something good or bad. All I know is that to survive I must jump into the water. It seems that I am right near the ocean. I swim forward, trying to beat the land which is also racing forward. Then, at one point, there seems a sort of monster or demon that chases me. It too is on fire but submerged underwater. From behind me a friendly force fires a weapon and kills the monster. At once all the other fire in the dream ceases. Then the dream becomes vague. I seem to be greeted by friends, friendly voices. I am facing East in the dream-the sappers are facing East. I myself seem to be out on a mission, away from a main base. The sappers come from behind; the friendly forces are in front . I am saved when the monster dies and I seem to have made contact again with friendly forces. I am welcomed back. I have swum almost due South, somehow semsong  land and friends. "
33," I am in Africa again. There are abandoned metal objects on the ground. I seem to be with someone else; we are flying low over the ground, surveying the land. We decide to salvage a damaged plane. We pick the plane up in tow. It is unclear if I am flying the damaged plane or the one used for surveying. In any event I am at the controls and telling the other person with me that I have very little or no feeling of control. This other person, patient and willing, remains calm and gives me encouragement. "
34,". “Facts or Delusion” I dreamt that I was walking around in some kind of museum or exhibition and then I came into a room with some white fabrics - where the ceiling was made of some white fabrics. It could be silk. Blood was dripping from the ceiling and I got a little anxious about that and got hold of a guy who was director in the company where I work and he’s a very factual guy. So I showed him the ceiling, and he said it’s okay there is dripping blood down from the ceiling. And then I started looking down into another room or perhaps another world. The atmosphere was something with planets being created and destroyed, and there were earthquakes, landslips, floods, very big forces. There were fire, water and enormous power. Suddenly I saw that it was my father who was dissolving or disintegrating. I showed this to my husband, Bruce. And then I’m at some kind of a theatre where somebody is very keen on making some kind of play or musical. The musical or the play should be some people some groups in turquoise and white clothes and sort of looking a bit like a carnival and they should be dancing and hopping around. I find this extremely artificial and superficial, but somehow I feel I have to be a part of it as it could have unpleasant consequences for other people if I don’t want to join this happening, or whatever it is. It’s very unpleasant for me, as I find the theatre and the play very empty – it’s a delusion, I feel. When the play is over, we get some raisins and something they called stardust. And now my husband Bruce and I are walking along a road where there is a lot of weekend traffic. I walk behind Bruce and I’m leaning on him and crying. I say that I don’t want to be a part of this theatre or I don’t want to use this stardust. I don’t want to be a part of something that’s not real here on Earth. It has to be grounded. It has to be real. Then we meet a couple we know and the lady tells me that she agrees with me. She’s a very grounded woman with four children. Bruce is very uncomfortable too and doesn’t want to have anything to do with this stardust. "
35,". “A Dangerous Man” I’m in the sitting room in a house when suddenly a big red-faced man is storming into the house. He’s coming from the hall to the kitchen. He’s wild. He’s crazy. He’s excited or agitated and he’s red in his head. And I know that now I’m really in danger. He is threatening. I grab a bottle of turpentine which is standing on the table and because I want to throw it in his head. But they understand that my only rescue is a spiritual guide/teacher I had at the time, I’ll call him X. X is my only rescue, and the only one or the only thing that can be a counterbalance to this big guy. So then I concentrate on X. I concentrate on his physical form – the way he looks at a picture I have in one of the rooms in the house and the way he looked the last time I saw him. It is not my knowledge - my inner understanding - that can help me in this situation. It’s only the physical presence, the physical reality that X is what you could call a physical reality in the world. The dangerous man, he reminds me of a very scary person in Carlos Castaneda’s Don Juan books. This scary person might be a shaman. "
36,". “A Weird Woman” I’m looking at the television and I’m seeing a film or whatever it is or somebody talking about a woman that has killed a little girl. It’s a case that everybody is concerned about at the time. It’s a real life murder case. In the TV, I see a woman, she’s in her thirties blond hair, slim, and she’s in her home. In one of the scenes, she’s listening to some music that’s rather weird, mystic or different. It could be The Doors or something like that. This woman is living in her own inner world. She’s married to a man who looks like an older woman. In one of the scenes this man advances her, puts his arm around her, but she rejects him. And she rejects him in a sort of autistic way. The atmosphere is like the atmosphere in a film called Shock, where the main figure, a woman, has schizophrenia. At the end of the dream I tell somebody or somebody tells me – I don’t know if it’s while I’m still looking at the TV or after that – but anyhow, I say to someone or someone says to me, “it was her own shadow she wanted to kill.” And that’s the end of the dream. But there’s another thing about killing children as that was a TV portrait of a woman who has made a film called Miracle, and that’s about killing a child, too. "
37,". “Home and Back” There are some travel entertainers and some women who are very keen on liberating women and they are very impulse driven, and they are dancing or being on a street or I’m not quite sure of the surroundings. But I feel very attracted to one of the men - he’s in a green coat. But I keep my feelings back because of my husband, Bruce. Because in this dream he’s rather sad and oppressed and he tells me that one should just concentrate on meditation - the meditation practice. And then there’s a very merry party in a church, and a girl - I don’t know her age – but a girl is dancing and hopping and jumping around up and down the church floor. It’s a very energetic and merry party in the church."
38,". “Mission Completed” I’m at an island and I have a task to do. I have to bake a cake to a king or some prominent person and the cake has to be finished at a certain time. And I can only do the ingredients I’ve been told to use. And the cake is ready at the time it should be and I have only used the ingredients that I was allowed to use. Then I say to a man - I don’t know if it’s a king or just and ordinary man – anyhow it’s a man who should make sure that the cake is transported from the island and he should do that by boat onto the shores near this island. The weather is rather windy but it’s not storming. It’s very obvious in the dream that my task is finished and I have done what I was supposed to do. But there is some uncertainty about the man’s competencies/abilities. Will he be able to get the cake to the mainland? And there’s also something in the dream that’s happening on board a ship, but I don’t remember that."
39,. “Two Different Guys” or “Mediation/Negotiation” There’s a big guy who wants to fight with a little guy. And he actually wants to kill this little guy. The little guy is afraid. And then a woman goes in between them as a mediator and starts negotiating with the big guy. 
40,". There’s a big guy and there’s an association in the dream to John Wayne. Ann saw his film, Red River, the night before. And this John Wayne guy has captured Ann’s old school, in the small village where she grew up.  I’m together with a very unusual wonderful handsome clever girl. She’s about - years old. But sometimes she’s younger because I’m carrying her in my arms in some parts of the dreams. Everybody, all people in the whole world, agree that this girl is a very special child filled with love, calm and warmth. Everybody thinks that her wonderful soul or whatever you would call it, her essence, has to do with the fact that her mother was blindfolded. In the dream, this English word, “blindfolded” comes up. The mother lives at a big farm, a farm that Bruce and I visited at some time. I can see the kitchen very clearly and I remember precisely how it looked at the farm and how the atmosphere was. There was a lot of room, but it was all a bit dark, perhaps a bit lonesome, too. I see the contour of the mother. She looks like the women, the farmer wives, I knew as a child. I’m trying to convince the John Wayne guy that he should open the school and let people come in – the people come up to the school – because the school is on a hill as it was in real life. Then you can see a lot of people standing on a road. The John Wayne guy that has no guns or other means to keep people out, he’s sort of keeping them out with his stubbornness. He is rather stubborn and he doesn’t speak much, again like the John Wayne in the film. I love this guy very much, but it’s not an erotic atmosphere. My feelings for this man are deeper than being in love. It’s more like between children and parents, or between siblings. The connection is, it’s just there. Suddenly people start to walk up the hill where the school is. They are in party dress and they are coming with presents and they bring flowers, too. The first guy who comes is a psychiatrist I know. He’s very, very elegant dressed black and white with a hat and a red rose in his jacket. He has a big smile, but he’s rather shy. I’m leaning on the John Wayne guy and I feel very, very happy. For a very long time I can see the girl’s face before me - she’s slim, she’s dark haired and she has warm brown eyes. The school and the village where the dream is happening is the place where I grew up as an adopted child."
41,"Last night I had a wacky dream that I had two big bags of bird seed and cracked corn stashed under my dresser, along with a dictionary of seeds. In the dictionary entries for specific seeds stated when and where they grew best, what animals liked to eat them, and other useful information. I showed it to Mom along with the bags of seed and declared that I had no use for them, that they were a useless waist of my space. Mom tried to make me see that I really would need that stuff someday, saying that they would help me to become a better organist. I said that was totally wacko, that music and agriculture had no plausible relationship in my mind. She said that ground-up seed and grain were now a cheaper way for people to build pipes and relay apparatus. I still didn’t believe her, so she handed me a tape, one of her famous self-programming tapes where some motivational speaker used the life of a baseball star as an example of excellence. I put the tape into the boom box and the motivational dude started blabbering away. In the album liner for the cassette, I found the details and pictures for a recent install in some big church! This, by the way, had no connection to what the tape was talking about, except that at the end, there was a very mesmerizing pipe organ score ditty as the announcer signed off. And get this: . That tape came with a small baseball-bat-shaped remote control that was to override the onboard transport of the boom box. I didn’t know you were supposed to rewind and fast-forward with that thing, and so thus I got the boom box all messed up. This was the wackiest dream I’ve had in a long time."
42," I am using a computer. I point to a screen that is showing a documentary on Cambodia. There are a few scenes of the capitol city, then a man accompanies a woman singer, who has related several medical problems before regaining her voice. She sings as he plays the piano. I change the screen and see images of the war. There are helicopters on the ground waiting to take off. It is live footage. A platoon is running down a jungle slope. One soldier throws a grenade. They are chasing the enemy. Then I am part of this platoon and the terrain has changed from a hill covered by thick bush to a long slope covered by short grass. There is bamboo on either side. We begin to take incoming rockets. I hear the initial whoosh, followed by the thud and crash. Then the rockets come closer, and it is clear they are aiming at me. They are walking them in like mortars, not vertically, but horizontally, missing me by a few meters at most, and I must anticipate the next rocket by moving correctly either to the left or right or I will be killed. It is like a child’s game. I am trapped out in the open, running back and forth every few seconds, completely focused on what is taking place. I am not scared, but then I see the enemy behind foliage and a wire fence, launching the rockets, which in fact whiz past me like huge . caliber bullets. I see my brother, as if he were young, and I yell to him, yell loud and with anger, “Get my  and ammo, get my  and ammo.” Instead of running to help me, he simply walks toward where my things are. I yell again, dodging and side stepping rockets, but he continues to plod along, and I am angry at him, because he is acting like this is a joke. He is either ignoring me or incapable of helping me, or more likely, both. I wake up fearful and angry. "
43," Capt. Plucinski, the battalion surgeon, places a slender nylon noose around my neck. Attached to it is a loaded . automatic. He tells me to shoot myself. I can feel the fear turning into the necessity to resist. I will kill him instead. I probe the bottom of the grip; there is no magazine. From somewhere I obtain a . and shoot him in the head. However, recollection is unclear at this point, and this may or may not be the case. "
44," I am walking my dog in a field. The field becomes heavy bush and triple canopy. Where is my dog? Is she lost? Then I am in Vietnam and we kill many soldiers. It is a recollection from the war. The dead lay clumped in heaps, like pictures from the civil war. Then the situation is reversed, as in the dream I imagine what it would be for an NYA to corne across American dead. I wake up anxious, angry and fearful. "
45," I am on another planet, caught up in a war. I am hiding in a cave. Attacking soldiers find me. The first one shoots me point blank; his rifle misfires. The second aims and shoots just as the atmosphere begins to freeze. It forms a protective shield in front of me. The bullet punctures the ice, then falls to the floor. The solider outside suffocates from lack of air. I am next, but the dream changes. A civilization on another planet is in the act of committing suicide. Soldiers have paired off in rows, they are separated one from the next pair by ten or fifteen meters. The distance between two soldiers is twenty or thirty meters. Armed soldiers advance against their unarmed partner. I am not paired up, but caught up in the fray and in immediate danger of being shot. Recollection becomes unclear at this point. I wake up anxious."
46, Dream Fragment. I am in a war. A plane of unknown origin flies overhead. It is identified as hostile and anti-aircraft guns begin to fire at it. The plane circles around in the cloudy sky and begins to drop bombs. The explosions are sharp and devastating; fountains of earth raise high up and fall back to the ground. There is a fire storm of smoke and flame. I run and become engulfed in the haze. I find a clearing and find my dog. Recollection ends here. I wake up anxious. 
47," I am with Jamie Harter on a trail in Vietnam. We are in a hostile environment, though at the same time on vacation or holiday. The terrain is wooded and tropical. I begin to tell him about war, about Chicom's and combat and death. We are both armed. I am fearful of going out on ambush. The next moment I begin to weep and sob deeply. Recollection ends here. "
48," Dream  I take the wrong bus to go to a dance and to meet women and decide to go instead to a movie. There is a new film on the Korean war. At the last moment I decline the movie, which is very crowded outside, and begin to walk. I am near a police station. Off in the distance I see a riot taking place. A group of people have broken several one and two story windows and are looting merchandise. I say nothing. The police finally take notice and storm the building. I am now with other people watching what is taking place. The rioters jump onto an electric building scaffold and zoom up to the top of the building, maybe ten storys. The police follow and enter the building. Immediately, one girl jumps from the top story. We watch as she plummets down. I turn away at the last moment as she hits the pavement. When I look back, her head, likely split open, is covered by a sheet. A woman next to her is wailing. The body moves. She is still alive. She is moaning. I go inside the building with someone else. We believe the others have jumped from one rooftop to another, making good their escape. We are in the basement. There are huge empty rooms. We go up one or two flights. The rooms upstairs are also empty; made of wood, they are old and rotten. A black man, an authority of some kind, sees us. We run. He confronts us later. Recollection ends here. "
49," Dream : I am in a classroom setting. Bao Ninh is critiquing my work. He speaks perfect English. His voice is warm yet authoritative. He commends what is good, denotes what is imperfect. He sounds very much like Peter Kane Dufault. I am learning a great deal from him. He pauses, makes a general remark. I respond with a mocking reply. He becomes angered, saying he will not tolerate that sort of reply, hinting or stating the class is over. I apologize twice, and state I will leave in order for the class to continue; I will come back the next day. I apologize again. Inwardly, I am aware of anger towards him. It is the only way to explain what I have said. Recollection is fuzzy at this point. Bao Ninh appears to accept what I have stated, but I am forced to accept the conflicts of my own nature and to understand them. The shock of recognition is painful. "
50, I am with a group of Special Forces soldiers in Vietnam. We are attacked by NVA soldiers at close quarters. One charges us. He wears a gas mask and has a chemical biological weapon. One SF solider assaults him hand to hand.. 
51," I am on a rear base in Vietnam. There is a rumor it will be attacked in the evening. Outside where I am sleeping there is a small fortification. It is made of loose sand shored up on all sides. There is no barb wire; there are no mines or trip flares. I go from one man to the next, asking each one where I can get an M-, ammo and magazines, because I have none. A doctor reaches behind a wall and brings back a handful of plastic magazines that are made for toy guns. They are worthless. The dream changes. I am with a group of emotionally disturbed people. I am lying on the cold floor. There is a woman the others want me to be interested in, but I have no desire for her. I am aware of giving way, to regressing, to curling up like an animal. "
52," I am in a snowy field. There is much chaos and confusion. Everything is blurred by thick swirling snow. Refugees are wearing thick clothing to keep warm. I am trying to find the Americans. I go to a woman I recognize. She is a reporter. She is calm. Panicked, I ask her, “Where are the Americans?"" She points and says, ""By the woman with the child."" I run in the direction she has pointed to. There is no one. The same woman appears. She is sitting at a table. She gives me three letters. They are addressed to me and contain official or important documents. The letters have been opened-searched. I go back to the snowy field. A man and a woman lumber towards me. The man comes up close and suddenly points a long object at me. It appears to be a stick. I hesitate. He shoots. I fall and feel blood flooding my chest. I feel the life force going out of me. I experience the process of dying, which is very ordinary. I am not afraid. Just before death, I wake up. "
53," I had a dream that I was, that Mom gave me a sheet of ten cities that we were supposed to fly to. And she had an art thing set up in Albertson’s, and it was on a plank floor that I could hardly stand on. And Mom and I and Aunt Mary were supposed to go to these cities, and so we did. We went to the airport, and we were still walking on that same floor that I could hardly stand on, and we were walking like pigeons on top of this security thing instead of __turning?_____, and we stepped in and walked through the things that the bags go and before we knew it, we were on this people mover car thing that was going - miles an hour. And then I found myself on the steps leading out to the parking circle at school. Then I woke up."
54," Anyway, last night I had a dream. By the way, this is June the first, and I had it about a week ago. I’ve been lazy and I haven’t felt like recording it. But anyway, I had this dream that Elizabeth and a few other people and I wanted, we were in this bank, and she had to cash a check, and we were bored waiting for this lady to finish doing her thing. And we convinced them to give us an elevator key so that we could get on it. We got on it and we said, “I wonder what’s up on the tenth floor?” So we went up to the tenth floor, and this elevator had a blue interior, and we got out – or we didn’t get out – it was this very dark, closed-in room with light-up stained glass murals on the walls. One was like a map of the world with red continents, another was like something really abstract. So we decided, “Nah, let’s not stay up here. Let’s go down to the below-ground level and see what’s down there.” And I thought, “Oh gosh.” I hung onto the railing in the elevator as we descended, almost like a bullet, we hit bottom, and the door opened, and I was expecting it to be as dark as anything, but it was a banquet, luncheon hall and there were people having their lunch in there. And Andrea stepped out of the elevator and was going to go spy on them. But then I was up last night, and I had a dream that her and I were with some other people, and oh, she came by to say sorry that she hadn’t called me any more, and she wanted to go through a box of jump with me. There were like a box of broken eggs and empty cans and there was a ball and things like that. there was this two-channel mixer that apparently I had gotten for Christmas, and I just ditched when the current one came along but it was in the bedroom, and it could play ___?____ and the bedroom one could only play __?__ which was not true in real life. And so I’m constantly switching back and forth between the two, and then we started going through this stuff. And I thought I saw the CD at the bottom of the box; I thought it was the one that I had been wanting, but it wasn’t. It was just some blah CD. And then she and her family and I were at the beach and we were diving in this cave, and they were saying, “Oh, look at this, oh, look at that.” And it was pitch dark, and so I was feeling around and there were these like huge tarantula things swimming in the water and big sharks with scaly fins. And I was running out of air in my breath, so I had to get out. And I had to take my clothes off for some reason, and then run past everybody and ___run_ in the bathroom so that I could put the clothes on. And Mr. Powell  and everybody saw me as I was running past, and they were just shocked. And when I got in the bathroom, I woke up."
55," I am witnessing the execution of individuals at close range. They are shot by men with rifles. They are in uniform and of the same race. They are Asian. There is very little sound or movement, no struggle or attempt to flee. The shot is fired, the body falls. "
56," I am with someone else. We are in Vietnam, walking through swamp and terrain bordering a river. It is the present, not the past. We are lost. We pass an American who holds up a strand of fishing line with a lure attached to it. He says, ""This came all the way from TEXAS."" We continue walking. I say, ""We're supposed to be going to An Loc or Loc Ninh. I take the lead, follow a path, a well-used trail, and emerge in a clearing. It is clean and well-tended; I am reminded of Maplewood Park. Recollection ends here. I am in a trench in charge of an M- or a SAW machine gun. Opposite me, less than ten yards away, in another trench, are several Americans. Lt. Sharp tells me to fire on them. I don't want to kill them. Waking up from the dream I am half shouting, ""Get down."""
57," I am struggling with a policeman who has caught me stealing from a car. He shoots me point blank, a flesh wound. I run. He shoots me again and again in my chest. My blood spatters on a wall in front of me. I am dying. "
58," I am in a small shack in the woods, terrified. A nearby machine gun roars without let up. Raising from the wooden floor, I go to the screen windows to see what is happening outside. My vision becomes blurred and I cannot see. I wake up anxious and frightened. "
59," I am with a group of people in danger. Sitting, a light skinned black woman is speaking. She repeats over and over, ""If I ever go to such-and-such place . She is unaware that she is dying. I take her in my arms to divert her attention. I imagine a man from behind will execute her. At the last moment I will say, ""Never mind, shoot us both."" "
60," In daylight, I am with a group of people walking along a road or trail. It is as if we are refugees. I walk next to a woman who is old and smelly, who has a heart condition. I do not want to be near her and move on. We finally arrive at our destination. At a picnic table I sit with a young boy who is looking through a thick book about war. He is reading the section about Vietnam. I look at the pictures with him. Several NV A soldiers have dragged two dead GI's into a street and are castrating them. Then the images become real, and we are caught up in an NV A attack. It is dark and difficult to see and they are over running our position. I hear screaming and bullets and a grenade explodes near me. Moments later an NV A comes over the berm and bayonets me. I wake up."
61," With a black man I am on a boat or the tip of an island, at war at sea. People are trying to kill us. I have several grenades strung together like a six pack of beer. I unhook one frag then activate one by pushing the safety off and pulling the pin, hurling the remaining grenades into the ocean. My aim is short but effective. There is a very big underwater explosion and subsequent whoosh and blast spout of water. We laugh and grin, knowing we have killed the enemy. "
62," I am in charge of a LLRP squad which consists of myself, Larry Roy, Joe Dorio and a good-looking young woman. We stalk through dull and gloomy jungle. I have a crush on the girl. She does not respond to my overtures, but she does not push me away. A new man is sent out to replace or challenge my command. I shoot him in the leg. There is some kind of alert and I begin to sort through the bandoliers of ammo. Larry Roy or the girl tells me to just hand them out. Then we are ambushed. I am up in a tree, drawing fire. I shoot back with my forty five. The bullets are strong and powerful. I yell to Larry Roy to throw a frag. I can see the dinks shooting at me. I yell to Larry Roy and the girl that I am not going to die for nothing. I tell the girl I love her. Then I am shot. "
63," I am with a group of excited soldiers in a foreign country, Palestine or Israel. We are in large, open but fortified area with many steps and rooms. Everyone is armed, waiting to assault or be attacked. I speak with the leader, a very important man, but can only obtain a . pistol and some ammunition. I am not afraid to go out like this. "
64," I am with a platoon of Israeli soldiers dressed as grunts. It is dark and raining, Everyone wears a poncho. We are climbing the rungs of a vertical tunnel. No one talks. We are going to war, "
65," In farm country I am one of the last survivors of a group starved, shot and burnt from their homes, Everywhere, the decaying dead rot in tall dry grass, We wait for death, I talk with the opposing force. A young man, friendly, gifted in mathematics, offers to end the fighting by settling monetary debts. He shows me how much we owe in relation to what is owed us. His side has wealth from lottery winnings, Quick calculations reveal the debts are equal, I accept his peace offer, stating I will tell the others if he does not kill me first."
66," I am at Pine Grove sleep away camp, where I had spent summers as a teenager, preparing for war. Jets flying low overhead fire rockets into the distance. We cheer as the missiles whoosh and spiral to their targets. We move out, young soldiers, all less than fifteen. In a large field several teenage soldiers explode a device that releases a smoky fog. It appears to be toxic. At detonation I am hit by its shrapnel. I feel the cardboard splinters penetrate my back, though they do me no real harm. We march back to our starting point. I am walking uphill on the wide trail which leads from the lake to the bunkhouses, weary from the weight of my gear. I walk next to a youngster who is out of shape. He huffs and puffs. He carries a silver-plated toy luger in his hand. "
67," In Vietnam, as a witness, I view war at close range. The first thing I see in the crowded street is an AK-, stuck into a wall by its bayonet. There are angry words written on its stock, but I cannot remember them. All around, Vietnamese men are frantically fighting, shooting back over a wall or barrier. I am lying on the top of a bunk bed, sorting through the belongings of someone. This person, apparently dead, had collected stamps. Paging through a small album, I see many American air mail stamps I recall from my youth. Suddenly a man nearby is shot and falls. I see the bullets kick and sting the dirt near him. Two nurses, wearing red and white striped dresses, come to his aid. They are completely vulnerable, turning their backs to the enemy. I am amazed at their bravery or foolishness. One nurse in particular attends to the man, who is mortally wounded. "
68," I am in Cambodia at the ambush site where the others threw themselves on me just before the explosion from the second grenade. In the dream, instead of guns chattering or the short snap of the chicom's's fuse, both sides scream and shout, preparing to rush forward in hand-to-hand combat. The NV A come at me with bayonets drawn. I offer no resistance, but cower and steel myself for the killing thrust. They prod me once or twice in the sides. Then, before death or capture, I wake up. The word surrender is very fresh in my mind. I feel anxious and weak and sick."
69," A. man is lost at sea. I help to rescue him. In a strange place we listen and attempt to accompany sophisticated percussion music. There is war. I am hit with shrapnel in the back. Bao Ninh tends to me in hospital. He is clearly in charge of himself and the matter at hand. Like a Zen master he is deliberate and clear in all he does. I complain and grow anxious, become uncooperative. Bao Ninh ignores or engages me depending on my awareness of what is correct. At one point he appears to give up, though recollection is unclear. I wake up still much moved by the force of his personality. It is not unlike that of David Boyle. "
70," Dream : I am a pilot in a helicopter in Vietnam which has just crashed. Either the low altitude, or the jungle canopy or both provide for a soft landing and very little damage, though it appears my co-pilot is slightly injured. There are only three or four grunts on board. I give them an order to form a perimeter. They do not obey. This becomes the basic tension of the dream: Am I or am I not in control? It would appear that I am not. We are spotted by some friendly civilians and again my orders are not obeyed. This happens a second time. "
71," Dream : I am a civilian on my way to work in the dark on a road crowded with many other pedestrians. People begin to sit by the side of the road; something has happened. I search for a friendly or familiar face to inquire, then sit on a bench next to an older European man. He tells me a plane has crashed over an airport and that all flights have been canceled. Next, I look up and see many helicopters, as though there is an enormous combat assault taking place. I board a small Loach after it appears it is not taking passengers. I am now loaded with combat gear. We fly in part of the combat assault formation and land on a base. There is no combat but it is unclear when and where we should go. An Asian man directs me down steps to an empty high school lab. I throw down my gear and try to sleep on a lawn outside. I am woken by a solider tugging my arm. He is upset over something I have caused. It is not serious and the solider is not angry, only concerned. "
72," Dream : I am one of only several white people caught up in a large group of black people who treat us well but whose aim is to kill us. I am with a woman who is either my daughter or my wife. Depressed and stoop shouldered, she is un-insightful, quiet and stubborn. We are running, being herded up steps and through hallways. At one point there is a chance to escape. The woman hesitates and I tell her to follow me or let go of my hand. I break free and run down a stairwell which leads to an Asian man with a mop and bucket. The area is fenced off. I implore him to let me pass. He is friendly but suspicious, but then tells me where to go and what to avoid. "
73," I am with a group of men who are submariners. We are on land in the country. They have been detected and seek to escape. They seem to be a mix of Americans and Russians. I climb on top of the submarine, which is also on dry land; the Captain, a Russian, stands beneath me, I steer the ship like a car down a long dirt road. We are spotted by Russian agents disguised as civilians. Soon we are being chased by men who seek to arrest us. I drive faster and faster and seem to have lost them. Then we must get out of the submarine because I have driven into a cul-de-sac. It is now every man for himself; I try hiding in the cellar of a barn, but am not quick enough, and am caught, as is the Captain. Then I escape, I run and find a woman sitting outside her house and ask her for help; she does not help me. I keep running, I seem to have obtained freedom, but then I am at the edge of the sea. There are great sand dunes that reach into the clear water. I am being pursued again and have no choice: I swim into the ocean, The water is warm and clear, the waves are big but not violent. It is very light and sunny, I attempt to escape by swimming under water. However, at close range three Russian agents triangulate my position. Looking beneath me, I see a large dark American submarine that has come to my rescue and begins to rise from below. However, it is too late. The agents begin shooting with pistols and high powered rifles and I am shot. "
74," I am in Ivy Hill Park, a place where I spent much of my childhood, I am near the tennis courts, Mike Wilson, the RTO in Vietnam, is with me. Above the tall trees a commercial plane veers low and loud; the left wing hits the top of tree branches and ignites; the plane spins and tumbles in the air, then crashes. I am directly in its path and move away just in time to avoid being killed by large pieces of bouncing wreckage. A capsule like pod nearly crushes me, but I manage to avoid it. The capsule is on fire and the pilots inside are trapped. The escape hatches are fiery hot but from within or with my help they are opened. I yell to the pilots, “Reach in and drag them out.” We are all afraid the fuel tanks will explode, Then we are safe. It seems two pilots survive and one is dead. "
75,"My first experience with the beginnings of an OBE. Fell into a catatonic, sleep paralysis state, as I have often. Reminded myself it's NOT a frightful experience or place and slowly calmed down. The thought of projection came to mind and immediately the vibrations throughout my body increased and i heard a low buzzing sound. I felt my feet begin to lift and at that point I freaked and woke up."
76," With two other men I am in Ivy Hill Park at the center of a large and parched field. There is much dirt and hardly any plants or grass. Suddenly mortars begin to drop close by. ""They're walking them in,"" I shout, terrified. Swirling, low-hugging clouds erupt where the bombs hit and explode; they fall in a neat vertical line, closing on our position. We run up field. I turn around and see a dark brown wild horse caught in the bombardment; it escapes with few or no injuries from shrapnel. Then a black man, handsome and confident, appears down field. He swings a golf club in our direction. I recover the irregular red shaped ball and throw it back to him with unexpected precision. He catches it on one sharp bounce and thanks me. "
77,"Still trying to have a lucid dream. It's amazing how many things happen in my dreams that are OBVIOUS dream signs that my mind just doesn't want to recognize. Practice makes perfect. Last night I had a dream here is what I remember. I remember being at my mom's house, . I was staying home from work sick . I called my boss to let him know I wasn't coming in, he sounded as if he didn't believe me, this made me feel very uneasy. So much so that I almost thought it had really happened when I woke up. I also remember a moment in the dream where I showed my mother my new tattoos. When she saw them she said ""oh those are REALLY cool, I really like those."" Now that should have been a SURE SIGN I was dreaming because those words would never part from her lips about my tattoos, which she still knows nothing about. Well she doesn't know about my new ones. Then suddenly I was with the daughter of a neighbor of my moms. The neighbor, Marie, is someone that lived down the street from us all my life. She is a wonderful lady and just recently found out she had cancer and has undergone radiation. She should be fine. Anyway I was with her daughter and we went over to her mom's house . I saw her, she looked ill, I gave her a nice hug. The suddenly it appeared she was having a party, there were all these people in their house . At that point I had to go to the bathroom but they were all occupied, for some reason this made me really upset so I left. Then I woke up."
78,"Last nights dream was VERY strange. Like dreams within dreams. Multiple stories intertwined and I only remember bits and pieces. One part I am with a friend, can't remember who. We were looking for a place to eat. Then suddenly we are driving in the car, we get on the highway and all of a sudden strange things happen, can't remember what it was exactly, but it was as if someone was controlling the weather in order to run us off the road. I do remember losing a tooth in the dream as well although don't remember when this took place just remember it fell out and I looked in the mirror and there was this HUGE gap where my tooth WAS. Then another part of the dream we were at this guys house, some magical guy that we were looking for. We saw him in the upstairs window and then he magically appeared downstairs. Of course dreams always work that way but in this case we were like ""Wow he teleported himself down stairs"". I have a feeling this man was not a ""good"" person but don't remember much else about what happened. Then I remember being at my mom's house again. This whole scene was very disturbing. I don't remember much except that there was some wedding and I was devastated that this man was getting married, as if he were supposed to marry me. I remember taking a picture of it and then running off. Within this scene at my mom's house she was being VERY VERY mean and evil to me. I have had MANY dreams where she was utterly evil . These dreams always disturb me. I remember being up in my old bedroom, as if i still lived there. She came up and started to go through my stuff claiming I had stolen some of her clothes or something. I was really upset at this point. She left and I looked out my bedroom window and there were these  stuffed animals hanging outside my window . At that point I remember going to my mom crying, saying ""I don't want to fight anymore"". That's all I remember. I know there was much more I just can't seem to get a grasp on what it was or what happened."
79," I am with a squad of LRRP's; we are out on a mission. I have grown close to them, and am especially fond of the leader and second in command. In the morning, before moving out, I begin to dress; they leave without me. I am angry and struggle with either catching up or turning back. I return to the rear area and ask about the men. The leader and second in command have been killed in an ambush. A survivor of the squad, dressed in civilian clothes, relates the news in simple terms, almost cheerful, as though he were familiar with death in manner I am not. Still, I am overcome with emotion; less guilt than a sense of the impossible loss of irreplaceable men at the height of their youth. I wake up feeling very sad and speak words I cannot now recall."
80," I am in my apartment in the Bronx, sleeping. I hear noise in the foyer. Two dolls, hanging from a door knob, have come to life. I speak to the male doll and the female doll and feel happy. I have made two friends. Then we are outside in a country at war. The terrain is hilly and partially wooded. Helicopters appear and fire rockets which explode in a suppressed manner. There is no full and dense explosion. Instead, on impact the force of the blast shoots out to the left and right. This happens several times. We begin running. A fighter plane appears overhead. I expect it to strafe us. Unexpectedly, it pulls up from a power dive and on the upswing drops a cloud of white powder or gas, which we run from. We are spotted or captured by police. "
81," I am caught up in the violence in the Mid East and am suffering a form of punishment. The Palestinians are clawing and tearing at each other, ripping themselves apart. I am not in the direct fighting, though hundreds of men, somehow far yet close and reduced in size, crawl over my feet and legs like ants, biting me and fighting amongst themselves. Periodically, an official, Israeli or Palestinian, it is not clear, asks me to write, in effect a subtle offer to set me free. He asks what time it is. My mother is present and answers. Then I do, correcting her. The man becomes hostile towards me. In the dream I do not accept the offer to write. I wake up anxious, having slept little at night though much in the day."
82," dreams that I remember from last night. The first one I only remember the end. I was going on a date with this guy named Kevin England. I knew him in elementary and middle school. However the date took place in the NOW as if we had known each other the whole time, very strange. I just remember meeting up with him and then hanging out, nothing significant sticks out. There was more before that moment but I can't remember it. Then I had a dream, after waking up and going back to sleep, that I was ONCE AGAIN at my mom's house. I was sleeping in my old room. I remember this baby alligator was under my bed. For some reason I was scared of it, but then the fear left. At that point I didn't realize I was at my mom's. When I left my room I went down stairs and my mom and dad were there. They were separated/divorced when I was  but they were together in the dream. I told them about the alligator and then came to the realization that this was their house, so they had to deal with catching this alligator, instead of me, I was relieved. I remember joking about it saying ""Well I'm glad I didn't find it in my house."" That's about all I remember."
83,"There was more to this dream I only remember the tail end. I was in some highschool, not the one I attended. I was in some acting class. It appeared that I really enjoyed acting and wanted to take part when the teacher, or some authority figure asked me to help clean up some stuff. I was very upset and agitated over this because there were all of these other kids in the class that really could care less about acting and if anyone should be taken out of the class to clean it should be one of them. So I left in frustration to throw some box away. Of course before leaving she told me where to throw it out, I however, wasn't listening too well and forgot what she said. So I went back and this time she came with me and showed me. Along the way I expressed my frustration about the whole situation. She seemed to agree yet she was the one who sent me in the first place... Finally we reached our destination, some lounge area of the school, and she told me to drop the box there, then I woke up."
84," Dream : I am on a patrol with another American. We set up a perimeter and ambush site. We are in the jungle but it is, in fact, a large civilian park. I ask him for my M- because I cannot find it, but it is lost. He gives me my .; he has the machine gun. In the morning, after an uneventful night, we head back to a car which will take us away. The car has been broken into. Items have been stolen. No one can be trusted. "
85, Dream : I am in domestic setting. A large and powerful tiger eyes and tracks a furry pet cat. The cat attempts to dodge and escape the playful swipes of the tiger. It eventually runs up a tree but the tiger easily follows. The cat has no escape. On the ground it shows no fear as it continues to rebuff the powerful play of the tiger. 
86," Dream : Principles of Life are being explained to me by John Kraft or someone like him. I am told to think of life as a daily game, to imagine luck or good fortune. I agree, but question why this works, since it does. "
87," I am in Vietnam with the men who composed last night’s group. They are talking too loud; I am anxious they will give our position away. We recon a small abandoned villa and examine an old foundation. Next, I am in a hospital corridor, walking with Steve Melhop, a squad leader from my old platoon. He has been shot badly in the thigh. As we walk a doctor points out the injury, which is bandaged and bleeding. "
88," Dream : We are in the jungle on patrol. I am speaking with Ray, RTO for the Command Platoon. In the dream he is youthful and trim, though his features are gaunt, hollowed out, wearied by fear and fatigue. The vivid terrain resembles Song Be, though the scrub and bush are sparse, providing less cover. Fear and dark foreboding are paramount in Ray's eyes. "
89," Dream : I am in a wealthy environment, much like Clinic am Zurichburg, the Swiss mental institution where I spent two months in . My family is present. Most prominent is my grandmother, who freely spends money, though she remains repressive and remote. "
90,"In this dream my x-best friend and i made up. then we went to a red hot chili peppers concert. while at the concert I noticed flea, of the peppers, sitting next to me. We were talking and then i looked down and noticed that i had not shaved my legs. Oh the horror... lol I couldn't have that so i left to go home in order to change. As i was leaving an old lady  was standing there, i asked if i would be able to come back, she said yes as long as i had my ticket stub. I had it in my hand and was walking back to the car and suddenly couldn't find the stub, realized i had dropped it. I picked it up, got in my car and couldn't find the stub again, had dropped it again. Finally put it in my pocket. I also found it strange that there were only about  cars in the parking lot at a full concert. upon leaving the lot i see a sign that says ""Alexandria""  with an arrow pointing which way to go. Turns out i was right around the corner from my house. I went in to change and then came back out to my covered car port . Next to my car was one of my dad's old ' chevrolet convertibles. There were  people in the garage that were going to go with me  they all started climbing in my dad's car, then i told them we were taking mine. i realized my car was full of crap and boxes so we had to squeeze in, as i go to sit down i sat on something, but wasn't sure what. after some investigation i realized some moron had sat in my seat and i was sitting on his lap, i told him to get in the back. then i woke up."
91,"This dream was about a website hahah go figure. i have been, in real life, helping this guy out with his website for the last  years. redesigned it a couple times and maintain it for him. in this dream he went to some other guy and asked him to redesign the site. of course he did an awful job so i couldn't understand why he would want that new crappy looking site over the one that i had done. next i remember being in this meeting with people from my job. my boss was there. suddenly discussion of this website came up . and suddenly i realized this asshole who had done the site was in this meeting too, so i got pissed off and left. scene change, i am in a room with my mom. we both look out the window  and see  big ass asteroids heading for earth. we of course freak out and we have everyone run to the basement. The impact must not have been too close to us because we all lived. scene change i was at my apartment and there was this dining room set in my dining room. for some reason it stood out to me, i remember thinking that someone had left it there and was going to be coming back to get it. i also remember being in the bathroom and trimming my hair, i had started with the top and sides and then something happened which prevented me from finishing. when i looked in the mirror i had a fucking mullet, you know short on the top and sides long in the back. god help me... so i went thru the rest of this dream with a mullet. Final scene involved the police. They were trying to find something, all i know is it involved someone i knew and i was withholding information that i was not going to devulge, what that info was, i have no idea."
92,"This one was strange. A friend and I were being held hostage in a bed? haha Some guy was in the room but he wouldn't let us leave, even though this took place in a bedroom there was nothing sexual about the dream. This guy was evil. He had me go through some dresser drawers while he watched, not sure what we were looking for but the contents of the drawers looked like my mom's dresser drawers at home. At one point i look over to my friend and it looks like she has died. He starts calling her name and she didn't respond, he had a really evil grin on this face. Then we did the dresser drawers thing again but this time there were objects i recognized as things i own . When going thru one drawer i saw a pearl necklace that i own and pocketed it so he wouldn't steal it. I saw my gold necklace lying there and gave it to him in hopes he would like it and leave, no such luck. At this point i just wanted to get the fuck out. I remember us getting into a scuffle. He had a syringe and was trying to stab me with it, i squeezed his nuts really hard, hehe then woke up."
93," Three NY A walked down a well-used trail over which second platoon had strung a trip wire and hidden rifleman with command detonated claymores. When the flare went off the mines blew. With third platoon I rushed up to watch as the men picked off the enemy soldiers. Their legs were blown off. They screamed to each other, firing their AK's wildly. I knelt and wept at the slaughter. Afterwards, we scavenged the bodies for souvenirs and did not bury the corpses. Mike Wilson put a live frag with a smoke grenade fuse under the bodies. We moved out. Fifteen or twenty minutes later we heard the grenade explode; other NY A had been killed by the booby trap.  am in a familiar house but cannot name it. My brother and I are young. He throws a heavy silver ring at me. I go to chase him but he hides and disappears. I go to a bedroom and look under the bed, but there is only a rumpled blanket. Then to the bathroom, where I see him through the frosted windows. My brother says, ""I guess  should come out."" I agree, and confront him with the ring, which I have found. ""If you ever treat me with disrespect again I'll kill you,"" I tell him sternly. I am boiling with anger. Next, we are out in the open in a desert-like setting. My brother questions if I mean what I have said. I am on edge and angry and seek an excuse to be violent. My brother says, ""You wouldn't shoot me."" I tell him to be quiet, not to test me. My brother continues, so I shoot him point blank in the skull. My brother falls down dead. He appears ten or twelve years of age. I am older, perhaps eighteen or nineteen. "
94,"don't remember much, i remember being with some group of people in a house but can't remember specifics. then myself and  friends went to some amusement park in our neighborhood. there was a ride where you sit in a chair  and then the floor and chairs start spinning. i wouldn't go on it though because spinning makes me nauseous . don't remember much else unfortunately. "
95,"at one point i was at my mom's house. i must have been young because in the dream she was pissed off about something and laying down all these really weird rules that i had to follow. like i couldn't wear the color red. haha... don't remember much other than she was really mad. then i was in someone's house and my friend's boyfriend, who in the dream was Scottie Pippin, was asleep on the couch. someone knocked on the door and there were about  REALLY REALLY good looking guys standing there.  of them were really nice looking twins... but of course nothing happened the dream took another direction. i remember being somewhere with some friends, we were in my car trying to get somewhere. every way we went there was major traffic, don't think we ever made it but i don't remember. then there was a point where my dad and his woman came to live with me . his car was in my dream again which is odd. i was going to go out with some friends to a club, and then i realized i had to get my mom's car from one of them. we found them in the club, upstairs in some back room and i asked for the keys. i got the keys but then things changed  and it turned out he had given the car to an auction place so they could auction it off. BUT the bad part was that i had put MY CAR in the trunk of my mom's car, yes you heard right, as if it would fit. so he calls down to the auction place and they had already sold it and CLAIM they didn't know my car was in the trunk. so i am freaking out, and then i realized i could just report the car stolen. that's all i remember. "
96," dreams last night, actually more but since i was ill i didnt try to remember the first one. the  one i was in a grocery store and ran into an old friend. if you all remember the rap group arrested development, well i went to college with the lead singer/rapper Speech  we were actually really good friends used to whoop his ass in spades all the time. anyway i ran into him in this grocery store. we chatted a while then i remember hooking up with his other friends and we all just hung. somewhere in there marijuana was involved, someone threw some behind the bushes not sure why. :) the next dream i was rehearsing at someone's house for this play i was in. i was acting opposite of one of my favorites laurence fishburne . for some reason at one point i removed all my clothing but it was as if it was no big deal, then i put them back on, as if i would ever do something like that :). anyway laurence finally had to go because he was tired but i tried to talk him into staying. that's all i remember. "
97,"  I am in the country walking with my beloved dog, Rusty. As usual, she is off the leash. I am reading a war story. It ends by telling how men, when desperate for cover, would dive down in the latrine area, only to be stained with shit. Just as I read this my hand is fouled by human waste streaked on the ground. I wash it off in a large pool of fresh clear water. The dog swims in the water. She is happy, though somewhat nervous and high-strung, as was her nature. We continue walking and arrive at a wealthy residential area. It is safe and quiet and there is much greenery. I wear blue jeans and walk with much confidence. The dog, as was her way, romps and sprints ahead. We arrive at a store which is closed. The dog jumps up on a small landing. I pet her and she places her arm on mine and nuzzles me. There is a profoundly strong and shared sense of happiness and well-being. In fact, the sense of love is the deepest I have felt in a long, long time. Then a young married couple oogle and awe and pet the dog and the spell is broken. We continue walking and it is good, but the intense feeling of love is lost. "
98,"first lucid dream! yeah! do you know what a lucid dream is? basically it's becoming aware you are dreaming, while dreaming, and then staying in the dream. . a few months ago i became lucid and woke up immediately so i didn't really count that one. but the other night i was having a dream, in my dream a friend named darryl showed up. i woke up  and i told myself ""if darryl appears again you will know your dreaming"". i fell back to sleep and someone else, named jerome, showed up in my dream. even though it wasn't darryl i immediately realized i was dreaming. then i thought ""what can i do"" so i decided to grab jerome and start kissing him, go figure. when you are in a lucid dream it is much different. as you know most dreams almost appear as if you are watching them, where when lucid you are actually there, consciously aware of what is going on and you ""sometimes"" have the ability to create and or do whatever comes to mind, although it stays very dream like in many aspects, as far as things constantly changing and not making sense... anyway i woke up about  minute later, but remembered the lucid part quite vividly. if you are interested in finding out more about lucid dreaming check out http://www.lucidity.com. "
99," Dream : I am with a group of soldiers under fire. The terrain is semi-desert and mountainous. The men are young. Some are new, others are experienced at war. I obtain an M- and fire it. The shell streaks through the night and explodes far away in a large billowing ball of flame. The RTO speaks without having to break squelch. Apparently the radio operates by voice recognition. He is frightened, trying to locate the other troops, since they are not to be seen. I need more ammo and cannot find it. I am high up in a tree with two small children. Opposite us we watch a mother bird feed her young. She flees at the approach of a giant rat. He enters the nest and scavenges for food. He slithers down, the dead body of an animal hanging from his mouth. The rat then begins climbing up the tree. The children are frightened. My plan is to let it crawl up to our height, then punch the glass collar though which it must pass to reach us. When the rat’s head is beneath the glass I begin punching. I disregard the possible damage to my fist. The glass breaks, blood streams down the tree from the rat’s smashed head. The rat falls away and dies. "
100," Dream : It is night. Gloria Emerson knocks on my door to waken me. I get dressed. I am young and handsome and brush my hair in a brash, swept back manner. We are going to a school. I wear no shirt but only jeans and a towel over my chest. I turn back and put on a shirt. Later, Gloria Emerson gives me the title page from a faded manuscript of poetry. She signs it but makes an error, which she crosses out and signs again. "
101," Dream : I am on a great snowy mountain with someone else. Two trained horses must run down the mountain as if it were an obstacle course or test. They perform tricks and must endure hardship. They are very powerful. They do not hesitate at the unexpected, but immediately improvise."
102,"ok one dream i don't remember much about except the fact that for a brief moment i realized i was dreaming again , became lucid, but i didn't gain or maintain control of that and immediately fell back into ""unaware"" dream land. the dream i do remember was after i woke up around  and went back to sleep There was this baby, and i wanted to spend some time with the baby but the ""mom"" said no. i have no idea who this baby was. anyway the baby was staying at someone's house, i happened to know who, so i went and picked the baby up anyway and we hung out. i think we went back to my mom's house but i don't remember. then i remember realizing that i had to get the baby back home without anyone realizing he was gone or that i had taken him. i remember asking the baby  that if i dropped him off a few houses away from his house, would he be able to get to his house, he said yes. then i told him to be sure NOT to mention that we had spent the day together, and he said ok. that's all i remember. of course i am not in the habit of kidnapping children so the dream was a bit strange."
103," Dream : In the dream I am at war. The terrain is rocky and dry. We are being mortared. The shells fall close. A nearby man who much resembles Ray of the CP  is struck by the blast of a near direct hit and killed instantly, though his body seizes up, as if he were struck dumb. There is no blood or sign of injury. A second man is killed in likewise manner. No one moves. I run for cover. "
104," Dream : I am in a residential area skateboarding down a narrow sidewalk. The energy to propel the board is obtained by clenching my toes or pushing down hard. There are many houses which are big and made of wood. The people are friendly. I am a guest, renting a room. A block away a tree catches fire. A fierce wind whips the fire out of control. At one point the entire sky is whitened by heat and flame and it appears the house which contains my belongings will ignite. No one panics. I rush into the house to recover my back pack. I am confused. Which room is mine? My things have been moved. I find them in another room. It is large and half open to the elements. On the way out I watch a good-looking middle aged woman undress. It is very erotic. Outside, things are calm. I meet a young man who is a veterinarian. He has a dog which has sustained burns to its back. The dog appears aware of its injury but remains feisty. Somewhat humorously I say to the doctor, ""So, you have casualties."" I cannot recall his exact words but he is optimistic. "
105,"I was at some sort of reunion. It appears in part of the dream it was a highschool reunion, in other parts it was a college reunion. For some reason everyone i ran into kept saying to me ""how's the bathing suit business"". they were all under the impression that i designed bathing suits for a living. of course i would correct them and tell them i was a programmer. The hotel we were staying at, parts of it looked exactly like the hotel i stayed at when i was in maui, go figure. i remember i kept wondering if my old college boyfriend would show, but he never did. at one point i was in my hotel room getting ready to change and all of these people started coming into my room, people i didn't even know. once i finally kicked everyone out, i woke up."
106,"Couple of dreams last night only remember the tail end of one. I was coming back from a funeral or something. i have been out of town for  days. I first stopped at my mom's house for some reason. suddenly i realized i had not gotten anyone to watch my  cats while i was gone. i was freaking out wondering if they were dead or not, trying to figure out who i could call that could go and check. and trying to figure out if they could have survived that long without food or water. I even remember thinking ""well maybe they drank from the toilet if i left it up"". very strange. the whole thing seemed very real and very distressing. i thought my cats might be dead, next thing you know MEOW MEOW MEOW my cat is waking me up. :)"
107," I am with a large black woman who resembles the poet Melinda T. We are sitting in the office of Dr. Anders. She listens while I speak about war. Suddenly a low resonant howl escapes me. The black woman says, “I know what that is.” I begin weeping."
108," On a cancer ward all the patients are men. One complains that his nose is too large. Another declares without his doctor he would have died but has lived an extra two years. The ward is home-like. The doctors are friendly. Each has his own cure; some succeed, others do not. My doctor is female. She is dedicated and loving. A staff member and I reach a doctor’s office at the same time. I push the door open. It is immediately slammed shut, catching my finger. The staff member knocks and is let in. I leave, aware that protocol must be obeyed. I become frustrated and rebel. For punishment I am sent to a large forest to gather pine needles in long neat rows. After several hours on my hands and knees, I try to escape. Using a dog, my doctor captures me. I quit the ward. In her presence I get dressed. I will be traveling heavy since there are my two traveler’s backpacks. I have a toothbrush too small for my mouth. My doctor tries to discourage me, but I am angry and sad. On the wall hangs a photograph of a male doctor at war. His pants are torn and dirty. His knees are wounded; he is running for help. I say, “What does he know? I was the medic. They all came to me.” I begin weeping."
109,in this dream my best friend Chyrise  came over and we made up. we actually had a full conversation but i don't recall it. In the dream some people came to my house very early in the morning. they had a key and let themselves in. i caught them at the door before they entered. it appeared to be people that worked with the condo association and wanted to spray for bugs or something. they were checking out my apartment. i basically kicked them out except for this one guy. we were talking and he mentioned they wanted to give me the condo that was on the floor below me. initially the conversation suggested i would be exchanging one for the other. but then later in the conversation  i was asking how the hell i was going to pay for  mortgages... it was strange. 
110,"ok last night was an interesting one. I don't remember much of it but I do remember it being a bit strange, what dream isn't. I was with some people and we looked up in the sky and saw this formation of planes  way up in the sky. Probably outside our atmosphere. We suddenly realized earth was about to be invaded, as the planes came rushing down towards us. Don't remember much more about that. Then I suddenly remember being on the steps in front of this building. I hear something coming over a loud speaker, but it was all cut up and I couldn't understand what the person was saying. I walk up the steps and turn around. I see this really colorful city, and suddenly come to the realization that I am dreaming. Oh yeah another lucid moment! This time everything was CRYSTAL clear, i still remember it vividly. As soon as I realized I was dreaming the city began to move. At first it almost looked like the buildings were breathing, but infact they were changing and transforming into something else. Then suddenly a guy who used to work on MTV, Dan Cortez, showed up, I still knew I was dreaming, we sat there and talked for a few minutes and that's all I remember. But what I saw was UNFORGETTABLE!"
111,"i have had sleep paralysis since i was . when i was young it was due to stress. now that my life has much less stress it occurs less frequently. now that i know what it IS and that it leads to great lucid dreams, it hardly ever happens! Go figure... Anyway it does happen when i haven't slept much. last night i went to bed at about . i was utterly exhausted. i fell into a sleep paralysis state . suddenly i felt myself lift out of the bed, slowly, up to the ceiling, then i floated back down to the bed. the moment i hit the bed my eyes opened. when i looked at the clock only  minutes had past, no way it was a dream. but in the throws of sleep paralysis the mind can be fooled, so who knows what happens, the only thing that counts is it APPEARED real, and isn't that all reality is? perception..."
112," I am sent to my old platoon without medical supplies, pack, weapon or ammo. We patrol thick jungle much like Song Be. In a clearing I carry the M-, sling it over my shoulder, but it is awkward and does not feel right. I become angry. We pass another patrol which has taken one POW who is larger than life. We enter a large school. I become lost. I speak with a young woman. She refers me to a man who listens to my story, which I relate with anger. He says I should not be mad at him; he is a CO, a conscientious objector. He asks if I understand the term. I tell him, “No.” I tell him I am politically and morally ignorant. I tell him I’m worried about my men. Who will help if they are hit? I tell him, “Look, I have the Combat Medic Badge, the Silver Star, two Bronze Stars for Valor, the Air Medal, the Army Commendation Medal, so I know about war and all I want is the right equipment and to be with my men.” "
113," This is the first time in a long time that I’ve actually been able to wake up and remember the dream that I had. They’ve been slipping away from me as soon as I gain consciousness for some reason. But the other night I had a dream that I was at this run-down house – kind of like Aunt Margaret’s house – and we heard this band playing. And Catherine and I were walking around, and we were going to try to record this thing, and it was playing in one of those portable classroom-like things. And we were walking around to get the best vantage point because she wanted to record it. And we even stepped inside and realized that it was much quieter in there, because their amplifier was, they had the wires like under the door and everything outside so that we could hear them. And it looked just like Mom’s vacuum cleaner, only without the hose. And then I was listening to a tape that was supposed to have some oldies on it, but instead it had some Blue Bird songs and some oldies. And I dreamt that Catherine and I – it was dark by then – we were walking and she gave me three numbers. One was -, the usual one. The other one was one that she had gotten for her birthday, but she got it taken away because she violated her curfew. And then the third one was another one that she got."
114," The other night’s dream, the one I just said, had a bunch of silver things in it: a silver unit to play the tapes on, a silver recorder that Catherine was going to record the band, and the band’s amplifier was silver. It looked just like Mom’s vacuum cleaner without the hose. And last night’s dream was full of red things. I don’t remember, I have no recollection as to what happened, but I remember walking in a red house and seeing red things, and having a little toy house that was red. I don’t remember anything else. Sorry, Charlie."
115," This is the morning after. I have to record this dream before it slips away. It is now firmly implanted in my head. First I dreamt that Josie and Marilyn and Dad and I were staying in a hotel, and I confronted Dad about canceling the Gordon House in the spring, and he actually felt bad about it. And he took us to this – right when I confronted him, he was wearing this robe like judges wear – and then we went to this park called Hamilton Inn Park. And it was out towards Rio Villa, or Josie said it looked like we were going to Rio Villa. And when we got there, we didn’t have to pay or anything; we just walked in. And we went up these stairs. Everything was in water up to our ankles. We were walking up this path and went up these stairs, and then we got in this pool and started swimming, and there were jets and vents, but I wasn’t terribly concerned. And we walked, or we swam – I swam right behind Dad, who whistled once in a while to help me echo locate him , and we pulled into this part of the pool that was under an overhang, and it got closer and closer and closer. The sides got closer and closer together until I had to get out and just crawl on the side. I couldn’t swim any more, they were so close together. And then I realized that in this echoing overhang they were playing a tape of scary sounds and I mixed it, without a mixer . How can you mix without a mixer? But anyway, after that I was just glad I could get down out of there, and Mom was saying she had to clean that pool area pretty soon. And then I woke up."
116," I had two weird, weird dreams last night. I don’t know what has gotten into my brain. The first one I had before I woke up at : o’clock in the morning. I dreamt I was in my room listening to my sound system, scanning the airwaves_ and trying to look for a song to record. And I must have been in there for an hour in the dream, and Dad comes in and says, “Time to shut it off now.” And he clothes it in a weird meaning. He says that the CD burner is a p__peeing unit because it’s going and recording in the same way that we go pee. I woke up at : in the morning and I was kind of scared, but I had to go pee. Maybe that’s why I dreamt that. "
117," The second dream was even weirder. I had a dream, when I went back to sleep, that Mom had brought me a Beauty and the Beast doll that sang the way Ariel  does. And I was, before I opened the box I was wondering where could the audio module be, because in Ariel it’s in her fin. And when I opened the box, I saw that she was just like a regular Barbie Doll on top, but she had, she had like a thing without a tail. She had no legs. And apparently that was the sound thing for her. And then, I saw Celine Dion rehearsing in the park. Anyway, I saw Celine Dion rehearsing in the park, and she was singing louder than anything without a microphone.. This pen is driving me insane. She was singing as loud as she could without an amplifier, and it was just like that she had one. And then I walked in to her hotel room and I saw her and her kids kind of peeking around in there. And I got to see the outfit that she was going to wear to the concert, and I got to talk to her, and her voice was quiet, just like Sandra’s voice. And I’m afraid this thing’s going to eat my tape; it sounds awful.  But anyway, I dreamt that me and Elizabeth’s family ran into her family and just talked. And then I woke up."
118," I had a dream about a week ago that I haven’t recorded yet. I dreamt that we were all this party, and Dad and Mom and I were holding hands with a bunch of other people in their , and we were all kind of marching around the trampoline and singing a variation of one of the songs that we normally wouldn’t even sing to. The real song goes, “Sally go round the sun, Sally go round the moon, Sally go round the chimney top every afternoon, boom!” And the rendition, the variation in my dream goes, “Cindy around the chimney, Susie around the sun, Cindy around the chimney, and then the work is done.” I can’t explain that. Then last night I had a dream that I was walking down this long hall with Mom and we were like at Tyme Gardens or something, and it was this exit place for handicapped people. And it was a long hall. And we finally get to where they open the doors, and we were supposed to ride on this little coup car thing, but we couldn’t because there was a storm coming. And then person who was supposedly a jet ski rental person came over, and Mom told her about the storm. And then suddenly we were at school and I was showing Mom things before we left for the last day. And it ended like a week ago. And I was afraid that I didn’t go and take one of my exams because I could only exempt three exams, and I only took two exams. But then I realized that Media was one of the exams and it wasn’t even like taking one. So then I was showing Mom the elevator, and she didn’t have a key, but she could put $ in it and go down to the first floor. And then we were sitting on a bench with this administrator lady and she said that everybody’s key is - oh, what’s the word? They have this thing in there where you can only go to certain places at certain times, and I said, “I have never noticed that,” and she said, “That’s because you’re never sick.”"
119," This is a few days later. Last night I had a dream – sounds like Martin Luther King, doesn’t it? But anyway, last night I dream that we were at this, that Dad wanted to put together a CD for Grandpa and he went to Specs and he got these CD’s. And we were standing on balcony at the mall and he knocked them over the banister and they all went falling and crashing down to the first floor. And, I don’t know, all of a sudden they had this CD writer on a picnic table, and he said that he went back and he got another one, and he was saying that this nun named Angelina wrapped the CD’s. And then I was, he had to take the sound equipment and put it in a box for some reason, and then he gave me the box and told me that I had to put it all back together. And I took the equipment out and set it back on my desk like it goes, and I was started to put the wires back in and they were all going in pretty good, and then the wires for the speakers on the west wall weren’t going in so good and I needed help putting them in. And Dad was on the phone, so I needed help putting them in. And I woke up before the wires could be connected again."
120," A few nights ago I had a dream that my sound system upstairs belonged to the school system, and that sometimes I would see some maintenance guy in a suit and tie come over and put the receiver and the CD writer on a cart and wheel it into my closet. And he said that that was going to be storing it until next year. And as soon as he left, I would take it out and put it back on the desk. And I had to return a book to the librarian, but I was too afraid to go up to her, and I don’t think I ever returned it before I woke up. Last night I had a very peculiar dream. First of all I dreamt that we were near a sea wall at the waterfront, and everybody wanted me to scuba dive. They said that if I wanted to stay down there for three weeks, I was going to need scuba gear . And also I dreamt that Sir Galahad was this paper Styrofoam bird with paper wings and a napkin folded and all for her tail. And she was really a listening device so that I could monitor what people were saying on the phone. And there was also these two other birds, Archie, my cocJanicel and then there was this white bird – very delicate with a plume – and wings that were raised up. And then both of those birds were kind of in cahoots with the Styrofoam Sir Galahad somehow, and the wings of the other white bird also stayed up for some reason. Then I also dreamt that I was sitting on the steps with my feet towards the up of the steps, and I was trying to get the mini-cassette to work, and the terminals were like way loose, and it wasn’t really cooperating. There was this big cardboard box ____??_______. And then Dad comes up the steps. Anyway, this tape is really squeaky now. And then Dad comes up the stairs and says that it’s my problem. And then I woke up."
121," This past week I’ve had three dreams that I didn’t get a chance to record. Actually only two of them that I can remember right now. The first one, I dreamt that I was back at Bancroft, kind of, and I was in a stairwell, and there must’ve been ten alarm boxes all on the same wall. And some administrator was saying that when the alarm goes off, these doors locked, and then you were stuck in there for the next half an hour. People would tell me that the doors close to prevent the fire from spreading, but I was afraid they’d lock, too. I also dreamt that I got caught shoplifting that time, and I dreamt that I had stuffed some pens and scissors in my socks and walked out, and one white person and two black people were not going to let me pass. And I dreamt that a police officer came and put me in handcuffs and then I woke up. Never experienced this for real, not sure why I’d dream it. The next one I don’t even remember. "
122," And then the last one I dreamt that I was already in Spain and that we were staying at this place, this lady was big and fat, and she spoke more English than she did Spanish. And she had a husband and three sons and we were all swimming in a pool, and then we got out and I remember that her house was kind of dark and that, hmm, let’s see. We were walking around these gardens and things and it was all supposedly a city of Salamanca, but there were no real buildings besides her house. And hmmm, I don’t remember anything else now, but I remember that I was so shocked that this big, fat woman could hardly speak any Spanish and she lived in Spain. "
123,"Ok last night I had a wild dream. There were all these different parts I will just mention what I remember, it doesn't flow too well because I am forgetting some things. Ok first I remember I was going to some costume party and I wanted to be the devil. But I couldn't find a devil mask. I looked all over my house and still couldn't find one. Finally my friend gave me a red cowboy hat I could wear, not quite the same as a devil mask but in the dream it seemed to satisfy me. Then I remember getting some tattoos on my lower arms and my hands . I don't remember what the tattoos were, other than some weird design and some words. Then, I suddenly realized I had tattoos on my hand that were now there for life, and was a little unhappy about that. That's all I remember about that piece of the dream. Next, I remember being in control of this car. I wasn't actually in the car, I was above the car, up in the air, yet controlling it, either with a remote or my mind, I don't remember. Yet at the same time I must have been IN the car because I was worried about getting pulled over by the cops. Anyway since I had control of this car I made it drive down these residential streets at like  miles per hours, hitting a few things along the way, it was cool heh. Then I remember coming to this place, and there was this guy and his dog standing there, but they didn't see me, although I thought they did. I got concerned because I thought they were going to start following me. I started walking along this path and came to this little structure with all these statues. I sat on one of the statues and watched the people. The statues were of Female Basketball players. LOL The next part of the dream, I am driving in a car with some other people, we were on a mission to do something, but I can't remember what. We get to the post office and pull into the parking lot, which was flooded and empty. As soon as we pull in another car, which looked like it was full of hispanic people, pulled up. The girl in the back seat pulled out a gun and pointed it at us. Then I remember getting out of the car and being forced to the ground, in a bush no less. The gun was pointed  the top of my head. I was scared shitless and shaking, can actually remember feeling it as if it were happening. Then suddenly a thought goes through my mind asking why I was scared. If I were shot I would die instantly and feel NO pain. I personally am not scared of DEATH, it's just the WAY in which I die that has me a little concerned. So I realized I had nothing to be afraid of, if it was my time, it was my time and I would go out painlessly. Then she moved the gun from the top of my head around to the back at the base of my head and neck. We were taken to this house. I knew, for some reason, that they were going to kill us, or at least the people I was with. I remember the people, who lived at that house, talking to me like nothing was wrong. They took one of the people I was with . At first it appeared as if they were going to cut his throat, but as weird as dreams are, they ended up giving him a tattoo right on his neck.  little symbols near his adams apple, OUCH. Then this black guy came up to me and asked me if I was bi-sexual. I don't remember what I said, and then he told me he was bi-sexual and walked away switching his ass like a girl would. Then I woke up. Talk about STRANGE! "
124,"Ok I only remember small bits of the dream from last night. At one point I was at some place and had to go look for my car. I went to look for it but couldn't find it. Someone was helping me but I don't remember who. We suddenly forgot we were looking for my car and just kept walking, then suddenly we remembered and went back. Although I don't remember ever finding it. There was this one part of the dream where I was at a friends house, a girl I grew up with. Although it wasn't her house, not sure whose. I remember something went on with her dad and we found a roll of money. I specifically remember seeing some 's, then a few 's, and then a  bill, that's right a  dollar bill, you would have thought I would have realized I was dreaming but, no. Anyway I toolk about / the cash and pocketed and left. I then remember being at my mom's for a short time, something tells me it was around Christmas time. This girls dad then showed up and told me he knew I took them money. But ironically he wasn't mad or anything. Then we all went out to some club, I was walking done this hall of what looked like some kind of strip club. That's all I remember. If anything else comes back I will add it."
125," Some of the dreams while I was in Spain. I can only remember about three; if not, only two. I didn’t have space to write them down and certainly couldn’t record them while I was over there. So I had a lot of interesting, fascinating, probably meaningful dreams that got lost. Okay, the first one: I dreamt that Mom and I wanted to take a walk, and we were going to bring the personal CD player along with the hand-held portable radio in order to listen to what the boats were doing out in the water. We were going to walk down to the waterfront. And we started walking and I got lost, and I just sat down and listened to the personal CD player. But when I was listening to it, the sound stung for some reason. And then we were riding around in somebody’s Fox  truck and it had a siren on it. And I had to stay like five feet away until they deactivated it. Another one that I had was that we were looking in Service Merchandise for a cell phone, and the cell phone that was supposed to be, it could, it was like a FM receiver or a hand-held thing. It really wasn’t a phone at all. It had three little knobs on it, it had a little display and an internal speaker. The sound was really thin and flat, though, but for some reason we were all fascinated by it. The next thing I know, we were walking In the park with this thing clipped to my belt. Well, I can’t remember any others."
126,"OH yeah, what better person to dream about. I am sure it's because I was talking about him all day I got front row tickets to their concert for September and I am HYPED, anyway on with the dream. I was someplace, truly do not know where. If I tried and describe it it was a HUGE room, similar to a conference or exhibit hall you would see at a conference center or hotel, yet it was all open space. There was some game going on and I hopped on this one team, no idea what the game was. Sully Erna happened to be a member of this team as well. I remember talking to him and kicking back for a while. There was another girl there, got the impression it might have been his girlfriend. Anyway he had to leave for a few minutes, so I was just sittin around and suddenly my BOSS Pat, from work, walks by. He looked like SHIT, like he had a massive hangover or something. We talked but I don't remember about what. Finally Sully came back and it was time for us to go. He was going to drop me off at the subway but I told him I really wasn't comfortable taking the subway this late, it was like  in the morning. So he said he would take me back to my hotel. There was another girl in the car with us and he was going to drop her off first. Next thing I know he and I are kissing in the car, yeah that's right haha. But it only lasted a moment, it was kind of strange. Finally we wind up at some persons house, he didn't take me back to the hotel. I remember having to use the bathroom but they were all occupied, I finally found one to use. Then I went in the back room and found Sully. We talked some more and then he reminded me of the last time we met when we were taking some dance class, and I was like, oh yeah right, I remember. DANCE CLASS??? I just can't picture that, man dreams are weird. Then I remember being outside walking with my friends chyrise, who also finds sully quite intriguing. We were walking down the city street and I was telling her how I met Sully last night, and hung out with him, she couldn't believe it. Then out of no where Sully comes up and grabs me and gives me this big hug, swinging me around in the process. He puts me down and continues down the street. That's all I remember. But it was a cool dream. :) Can't wait to see them in concert! "
127,I only remember one small part of this dream. I was studying this telemarketing script  and I walk into this office and see my  friends Emmett and Terry working at this telemarketing place. We talked for a moment and that's all I remember.
128," I am in a large room at ground level. Its green walls and floors are made of smoothed out earth. Large square windows without glass overlook a forbidding no man’s land. The NVA begin shooting. I return fire. They are everywhere. Several reach in. I push them off and continue shooting. They are everywhere, but I am not afraid. I keep fighting. There is no escape."
129,"WHAT? Squares of skin you ask? hehe Weird Weird Dream! I only remember one part. Somehow I got  square shaped cuts on my arm. I looked down at my arm and saw them. I touched one, and was able to remove the square of skin. I picked it up and examined it, even showed it to someone who was near by. Then I started looking at my arms and all these scratches were suddenly appearing. It started to freak me out. I do not remember, however, it being painful at all."
130,"I had one hell of a dream last night. Actually it was really , and the last , even though I woke up inbetween them, kept the exact same story line going. The first dream was short and sweeeeeeeeeeeeeet. haha I was making out with Aaron of Staind. Not sure why but I was. Anyway that's all I remember of that one *grin*. Then I woke up and fell back asleep. I was having this dream where I was on this adventure. Basically there is this computer adventure game that a bunch of us were playing as a competition. Whoever finishes first wins some prize, I had won last year too. The wierd part, it is a dream after all, is the game itself did not take place as a computer game, I was the character so to speak. So it was a REAL adventure game in some parts. I remember towards the end of the game I had to break into this store room of a drug store. I broke in and I remember when opening the door it was about  feet down. I got in and went over to this closet and grabbed some object . Then I was trying to leave and I was having an extremely hard time getting back out the door since it was  feet up and I am only '. I was pulling myself out but I couldn't get my leg up. I was worried the cops were going to come but I didn't hear sirens or anything. I did however hear an alarm. I finally got my leg up and got out. Next, I remember I was supposed to meet my friend Chyrise at  at my house. And I wasn't going to make it. I kept trying to call her on my cell phone but everytime my friend told me the number I couldn't remember what number he has said and kept fucking up the dial. . So finally I handed him the phone and he dialed. I got a hold of her I think, don't remember. That's all I really remember of that section. When I fell back asleep I remember that I so far had the fastest game completion time and was in the lead. Then I remember I was hanging out with some guy that I am assuming was my boyfriend or guy I was dating. We were at his house I guess but kepted getting bothered by all these people and couldn't be alone, it had something to do with his job. I was getting pissed off. We were watching some movie and didn't get to finish it because of this. I think we made out a few times too *grin*. Finally I left and went home, which was this house where I lived with a bunch of other people. He then came by later and we made up . More kissing. Then I remember some girl and I were hanging out and she was at our house and sitting there fussing about burning her hand. I went into my room and was going to watch that video. She came in and sat down and then said to me ""Irish people think it's wrong if you play the TV in front of them while they are injured, and you didn't even ask me what was wrong with my hand"". I was like ""What the FUCK, I'm part irish and never heard of that shit before."" Basically pissed her off enough for her to leave. Then some OTHER guy was there, don't know who he was but he was cute, and we ended up making out on the bed, DAMN I MUST REALLY NEED SOME SEX OR SOMETHING... All we did was kiss but he was a gooood kisser. Amazing how after the dream you can actually remember exactly what it felt like. :) Then there was some problem because his girlfriend stopped by so we had to stop for a while. HAHA. But that was ok another guy took his place later . Speaking of this other guy, it was some guy, again I don't know who, black man actually. Although I dated a lot of black guys in highschool so there was nothing abnormal about that. We were making out in another room for a while and then he had to go play ""THE GAME"". See the game from the previous dream found it's way back in the dream. I was still in the lead. He left with  other guys, they were all dressed up in some kind of costume. Then I remember walking down the beach talking to another guy who was just about to start playing the game and he had some questions that I was trying to help answer. That's all I remember. But hey I kissed  really cute guys that in itself makes a great dream. HAHAHA :) "
131,"Ok the first dream I am driving and it starts to rain. It begins raining really hard. Then the drops start hitting the windshield of my car and are so big when they hit they spread to about the size of a large pizza. THen all of a sudden my entire windshield fell into my car. ALl this water rushed in. I remember hopping out of the car and looking at it. ANd the windshield was just lying there against the front seat, it wasn't broken it had just become unsealed. Then I had this other dream and the most significant thing that pops out is I was faxing some sheet to a list of people and then stuffing the sheet into the appropriate envelope. Then later my mom comes in and I was very upset because I had wasted my whole day doing this shit and it was her thing to do and she hadn't helped at all. I expressed my frustration and then finally left. I met up with some guy and we just were walking together. That's all I remember."
132," dreams last night. One I was in some place, don't remember where. They all seemed to have known my brother . In the dream he was also dead and we were all just talking about him. I went up to this computer and remember seeing  pictures of him, that I had never seen before. I wanted to get copies and was trying to figure out how to get them off the computer. I finally figured it out somehow. Then I remember sitting over with a friend and all these people were on massage tables getting massages. Finally a table became free and I hopped on one. An older lady came over and started to give me a massage. Then she made reference to knowing my brother. I asked her a question but she didn't want to talk about him. The other dream I remember my mom was getting some job down near where I live. She was buying this house and was going to get paid $, a year, or so I thought. She ended up telling me it was only $,. That's all I remember."
133,"Ok last night I had a dream. My boss was in it as well as a girl named Mona who used to work with me. In one part of the dream I remember I was supposed to stop by Mona's house to fix her computer, but first I was going to stop and pick us all up some lunch. I went to some food court where there was a barbeque place. The sandwiches looked kinda nasty. I told her I needed  but then she only made one, so I had to tell her again and she didn't understand. Finally someone knew what the hell I was talking about and made the other  sandwiches. Then I remember we were all in these under water vehicles. If you saw the most recent star wars it was similar to what they were driving under water but they were on man vehicles instead of . All  of us were driving one and I think we were being chased by someone. Then I remember that in the dream we thought we were DREAMING that we were driving the vehicles , and my boss was saying that if we come out of the dream we would die. Then I remember getting back to the office and my friends chris and marty were there. They were telling me they were very excited because their live journal was finally back online. We chatted for a while and that's all I remember."
134,"Ok this one was odd. First I was in some group with all these other people. They were all playing some sadistic game that I was a part of. I have a feeling I didn't have a choice. This girl came up to me and she pulled one of my hairs out of my head and if I didn't say OUCH properly she would do it again. I started getting really pissed off  and finally got up and said something to the affect that this was bullshit and I wasn't going take it. The girl got in my face and I didn't back down, and what do you know, nothing happened. I left the room and then some of the other people in the group came over and we were talking and I apologized but explained it just wasn't my thing. Then I remember driving my car and I was drunk, I realized I shouldn't be driving so I was going to pull over and take a cab. I pull into this shopping center parking lot, it was late at night. TWO cop cars are in the lot but the cops weren't in the cars. As I pull in one of the spots I see one of the cops come out but nothing happened. Then I was no longer drunk and the cops were gone but I was still in the same parking lot. Some people  came out of a store and started shooting people. I remember immediately hitting the ground and acting like I was dead. They were walking up to people and putting a bullet right in their head, even people laying on the ground. I knew it was over. Then I hear sirens and they run. For some reason I had a bag of pot on me and had a feeling if the cops come I might be a suspect and didn't want the pot on me so I through it down. Then I realized my fingerprints would be on it so I picked it back up and started whiping my fingerprints off it. Then I was just like FUCK IT and left. I had this odd feeling, even though I had nothing to do with it, that the cops were going to come looking for me. I remember going to some restaurant with my mom and dad. We had to walk down this spiral staircase and then I remember my dad saying the cops were here to question him about some murders. That's all I remember."
135,"Ok this dream I was back in highschool but it was as if it was taking place in the present. I wasn't back at MY Highschool just in highschool. I was dating some guy  I remember we were at my friends house and I was sitting on his lap. This other guy, who I knew from my past, came by and was upset to see us together but seemed to act cordial. Then me and my man went to school it was the first day. I suggested we skip school, being the first day and all not much would be going on, but he didn't want to. So I left and went somewhere, that part of the dream I do not remember. Then I go back to a house, not sure it was where I lived and there were people there. There was a group of my friends  and we were all hanging out. We went down to the basement which appeared to be like a bar or a restaurant. One of my friends pulled out a gun and he shot someone . We all freaked out wondering what the fuck he did that for. Then we all went upstairs to get our ""story"" straight for when the cops come. I can't remember what we were going to say but I know I wasn't comfortable with it. Then my boyfriend comes over and we hang out. The cops never came, that's a dream for you. Don't remember much else."
136,"I did remember a bit of last nights though. I had written some ""song"" and someone else ended up coming out with it. A record company contacted me and said that since it was my song I should put out my version. Didn't even think about suing the theives that stole my song. They told me they wanted to meet with me in New York at the top of the Empire State Building. That's all I remember. hehe"
137," I am brought back to Vietnam; the platoon tells me I look good. I am wearing my old jungle fatigues and steel helmet. I have no gear, no leech straps beneath my knees, I want to tell them ordinary people think I’m strange dressed like this, but I stay silent. With Corson and Bill W. I walk to the water point. We pass through a small town, then into forest where I become lost. I walk to a highway, then pass through a circle of college students. I anticipate unkind remarks, but the students are friendly. At a busy traffic intersection a college professor smiles. “Where is the water?” I ask. He tells me. I find a dark, turbulent river. This can’t be the water point, though I know it is. Frustrated, I sleep under a moonlit canopy of thick brush. I wake up under a large plastic tarp. Crawling forward I accidentally wake Steve M. I say, “It’s me, Doc.” He throws me a pair of bowling shoes which are too small. A man I have never seen glares at me with contempt. He throws me a pair that fit. Then everyone leaves. I look out from beneath the tarp. Someone inside a nearby house appears in silhouette, then vanishes. I anticipate an ambush. I imagine being shot in the head. I imagine how Steve M. will comfort me. It’s raining. I have no water, ammo, or weapon."
138,"I swear I only get sleep paralysis now when i am utterly exhausted which is worse because I am so tired it's hard to stay aware of what's going on. If you are unfamilar with Sleep Paralysis go here. The short story it's a condition where upon falling asleep or waking up you get caught between this sleep/wake state. You are aware of what's going on but helpless. If it happens to a person who does not know what sleep paralysis is it could easily be mistaken with demonic activity and even alien abduction. I have no doubt in my mind SOME People who think they were abducted by aliens infact had a sleep paralysis episode. Anyway last night I fell into one of these states almost immediately. It's usually extremely hard to breath, which I can sometimes get control of. Last night I would feel like I could breath ok and then I would lose my breath again, this kept happening which made it frustrating. Had I not been so tired I would have been ok. I remember feeling an intense energy flowing me, I thought about projecting  since you can supposedly do it in that state. I remember feeling intense pain in my feet and my head, which was unusual. Finally I remember forcing myself to open my eyes, usually keep them shut when I am in this state. And yes you can actually have your eyes open, be seeing the room and still not be able to ""wake up"". Read that article I linked above. I remember kinda floating abuve my bed and I was going to try to turn around to see if I saw myself in the bed or not but then I suddenly was back on the bed. I woke up and only minutes had passed. The sleep paralysis happened once more, and I guess my brain had had enough, I kept thinking, wake up wake up wake up and I couldn't. It's the most frustrating feeling, and then you think you woke up and realize NOOOO you haven't. Finally I woke up, sat up for a few minutes and was able to fall to sleep NORMALLY! "
139," I had a dream last night. I dreamt that I was still in Spain, and that we were still in the apartment thing. And the apartment thing was really much blander than the one that we had, although you can’t get much blander than that. The girls came and went without me, as usual. Anyway, we were talking about going to this little school at night, and afterwards going to this theme park. And then we were at the school and Aretha Franklin and this other lady named Elizabeth were going to show us how to cook something, and then they started showing us how to cook it. And everybody was like zoning off and wanting to go to sleep and wanting to not pay attention, but then I remember going on a roller coaster that everybody was talking about, and you held onto some orange handles. And you would go down for a long ways and you’d go upside down and around and all over. And we never did get to the theme park. I woke up first. "
140,"Ok I only remember a few things about this dream. I do remember ICQ was somehow involved LOL. Then I remember I was walking in this crowd and the singer ""Bobby Brown""  was trying to get my attention. Then he said something about Mya  and I turned around and saw her but she instantly became someone else. That's all I remember there. Then I was in some house with some friends and Bobby gave me some marijuana. However it looked just like paper, yet I was convinced it was pot. Even was smelling it to make sure. Don't remember an aroma. Then I remember this part where my friend ran out of this one room and this HUGE snake  was chasing her. My other friend took a glass of water and poured it on the paper snake and it got wet and died. LOL Then we looked at my paper marijuana and dumped it out like confetti. Very strange. Paper seems to be the key in this dream. That was it."
141," I had a dream that our receiver wasn’t working and that Dad got all upset and mad and decided that he didn’t want anything to do with it. And so Mom and I were going to fix it by ourselves, and we started working on it, and we got the front left-to-right channels to work just fine, but no matter what we did, we could not get the surround sounds to work and we had a movie on pause while we were doing all this. And then somehow I ended up at the Homecoming dance and I was on the second floor of the main buildings looking out into the courtyard with Ms. Ross and Ms. Simpson, and we were talking about an overhead projector that was rolling through the courtyard to somebody’s classroom. And then I told them I had to go down and go to the dance. And I was at the dance and it was hot in the bright sun in the middle of the day in the courtyard, and there was a girl named Janice that was sitting at the sound board and her and I were talking. I had a dream that I was on a ship, of all things, and that we were going up and down and up and down long, narrow staircases with a bunch of my friends. And I was seeing alarm boxes everywhere, like fire alarm boxes. And I would get all nervous and jerky when I would see one. Continued on Side . "
142,I remember nothing of this dream other than some guy telling me I had nice fingernails. Ironically I had trimmed them before going to bed. In the dream I looked at my fingernails and wondered why he thought they were nice since they were extremely short. I seem to remember he was some guy from the middle east. very odd.
143," Last night I had a dream that I was going to have to go to North East this coming school year. I dreamt that I had Sir Galahad on my shoulder while I was walking around this hallway with white floors, and that we were going to have to go to the Guidance Counselor’s office to get my schedule, but the Guidance Office wouldn’t be open for the next three days until the coming Monday, which would mean that I would have to wander around until the office was open. Everybody else was wandering too, and these boys really liked Sir Galahad and all of a sudden she turned into a gray pigeon. And then I woke up."
144,"Ok I remember a bunch of things from this dream. First I remember being in some parking lot. It was night time and my friend and I were walking towards my car. This guy started following us so we turned around and walked towards him. It looked like he had a knife in his hand but it turned out to be a paper bag that he was holding. We kinda backed him up to the lit area of the parking lot  and asked him what he wanted. I don't remember what he said but we got the impression he was nice and could be trusted. Maybe even worked at the parking lot. So then he walked us to our car. We got in and he pushed the car  backwards and it fell into this ditch. I was PISSED. I was yelling at him asking him why the HELL he did that. Then this female cop walks up and stands next to him, looking down at us. Somehow she felt he was justified for what he did. I remember then we turned the car around and attempted to jump down  onto the highway below. We were, of course, successful. That's all I remember in that dream. Although the car plays a role in the next one as well. The next dream had some interesting parts. First I was with my old church group. We were at some event, and I was helping with the music. The guy who was playing the songs had to run somewhere so I was left there. The current song ended so I looked into the pile of music and grabbed some praise & worship song and put it on. I was crouching down behind the table cloth and realized I had no clothes on. No one seemed to notice, I managed to slip some clothes on at that point. I also remember seeing my old pastor in the dream, nothing significant about him sticks out. Then I remember we all went to someone's house. I had been watching MTV Cribs a few days ago and suddenly I am in Ozzy Osbornes house . His daughter was showing me around the house. I was looking at the pool in the backyard and it had  hot tubs around it, most were square and  was circular. They were all extremely small, would fit  maybe  people. The pool itself was a normal size. Then I was still at this house but suddenly lots of people were there. I remember this one chick I went to high school w/ named wanda was there. Anyway I went to a certain room to sleep for the night. I knew I had to work in the morning. I feel something else was involved with work but I can't remember what it was. I remember sleeping and then waking up and wanting to go home. So I walked next door to my mom's house. Wanda and one other girl came with me. I was in my room and I was eating a Honey Bun and then I had to go downstairs but for some reason I didn't want my mom to see the honey bun so I threw it in a room as I passed it. I get downstairs and I recall my dad being there too. I introduced wanda as wanda's sister for some reason. She was busy looking in the refrigerator for something to eat. Then I am getting ready to go back upstairs and my car  was in the foyer of my mom's house. I thought that was odd, continued to go upstairs. I really wanted to shower and I was going through the bathroom looking for soap, shampoo, etc. My mom had a really cool bathroom cabinet, it had all these little gadgets but no shampoo or soap. I think I then went into her bathroom and grabbed some from there and brought it back to the other bathroom. I then took a shower. That's about all I remember."
145," I dreamt that the Spanish group and I were staying at this strange hotel, and it had many, many, many rooms. And we were in this one room that was like a gift shop display room. And there was this fake wedding cake to feel that was supposedly Celine Dion and Rene Angelil’s, and supposedly there was a painting of Celine and Rene doing it on the wall, and the girls wanted to go somewhere else. This room was really neat. So I walked out with them and I walked around, and we got on this elevator that was absolutely bizarre, and the elevator would like go sideways for a long ways, and then slowly get down to a floor or two and then go sideways some more, and then get down a floor or two, and then go sideways some more. And so on and so forth. And then we got off and I was walking around again. Anyway, I was walking around with them, and I was ___?____ to go back to the room with them, but instead of going back to the hotel room, I went to the room with the wedding cake and stuff and was touching the pretend wedding cake. And then I seem to recall some man entering, and I remember walking around with this man for a while there, but then I don’t remember who he was or where he came from. I woke up."
146," Last night I had a very strange dream. I dreamt that I was back in Spain and that I was with Janice , Theresa, Deanne and Marie. And I had bought a suit case for somebody over there, probably myself, but I don’t remember. And I was rolling it around on the cart and Janice, Marie and Theresa were helping me roll it. And we were staying in this theater place, and everybody else was in a family-type place, and I was with Janice and she was helping me roll this thing around. And I had to cross this main___? To get outside _____?_____, and this dumb tape. Anyway, _____ found these steep stairs and she picked up the whole cart and was carrying it down, and it got steeper and steeper as we went down, and all of a sudden it turned into a swimming pool instead of a stage area and we were trying to cross with this cart thing. And the girls were, I sat down on the side because I couldn’t go any further, and I said, “Could you please help me?” and finally somebody came. And there was this Spanish guy and he swam me across. And finally we got out of the water and we were walking beside the pool; it was dark time. And they were still rolling the cart for me. We were going for the bus, and I told Mrs. Hammondabout the incident, and she said, “I knew something was going to go wrong. I just knew it.” Just the way she is. And then I woke up."
147," Last night I had a dream that Dad and I had been staying somewhere, and living somewhere, and I somehow had the notion that it was Spain, but I didn’t know for sure. I had just gotten back, and it was a week or so into school, and I was coming in, and I was walking back in the aisles in Mrs. H.’s class, and it was real crowded, and the desks were yellow. And everyone was filled, and I got the one in the last of the back row. And Dad was telling Mrs. Hammondabout what a hard time he was having teaching Spanish, and this one desk in the very back was yellow, but it was like mounted onto a table with the old Optilec  on top of it. And I thought, “How weird.” And Mrs. Hammondwas going to start a lesson and I then I woke up."
148,"Had a dream about my brother again last night. This one was a bit odd... In the dream my brother was in Straight . Anyway I remember bits and peices. I remember this one part where I got to see him. I walked into this room and he was there. I gave him a hug and just cried. It seemed extremely, which for me is nice because it's like seeing him again even though he is dead. We hugged for a while and then he warned me to be careful so I didn't get stuck into the REHAB. Then I remember thinking that he was over  so I wasn't sure why he didn't just leave. I remember another part where there was this guy, and we were talking in his room. He was also in the REHAB and was trying to escape. Not sure what else happened after that though."
149," I had a strange dream last night. I dreamt that Dad wanted to move his fire truck and hitch something up to it. So I crawled under it and it was like a trampoline thing, and when I went in it, it was kind of low to the ground, and I wondered how am I going to get out of here. But when I realized what they were going to do, I was scared, and I thought to myself, “I’ve got to get out of here somehow.” And then I asked Dad, who was up above, I asked, “Can I walk and down the walk while you guys do this?” And he said, “Sure.” So I wormed and squirmed my way out from under the truck. There was just enough room for me to squirm out from under it. And I realized that they were going to start up the engine and back it up a little bit, and then move it forward, so the result would be I would hear the back-up alarm and then hear the siren. So I figured I would walk as far away as I could and then be far way when that happened. So I took my bag – I don’t remember what I had in it at this time, but it will come to me, I’m sure. I took my bag and I went walking, and I walked, actually then I realized that the truck was parked in front of our house and I walked all the way up to  Street. And then I turned down  Street and went to  Avenue and like went around a few blocks, and then I came back and they hadn’t done it yet. And then I figured, “I gotta get out of here somehow.” So I started crawling over all these boxes that suddenly appeared, and I started crawling faster and faster and faster as Dad started – I couldn’t see him, but somehow I know that he was getting in the driver’s seat and getting ready to start it up. And I crawled faster and faster and faster, and all of a sudden it started becoming dark and I faded into consciousness. One other important thing about this dream that I remember is that somewhere after that I had another little dream about the digital recorder that we were using, that it was part of the truck, and that I was worried that maybe the back-up alarm or something was integrated into it because it had like the click on the side of it that went “drive, park, reverse” and I was deathly afraid of putting it in reverse. But I did, I asked him and he said that wasn’t the case, but they did, the gas fuel alarm thing on it. That was strange. But in real life it didn’t have any of that on the side. In real life it was just hunky dory, but it had bad sound."
150,"Ok last night I remembered  dreams. Basically had one and then woke up, went back to sleep and it continued. In the first part I remember my pastor  was in my dream. At one point I remember we were all sitting at a table talking and he was commenting on his hair, how he had darkened part of it. The top part was still gray but he had darkened the bottom part black. Not sure what the significance was in him telling us this. Then I remember another part where I was walking with a friend and we walked by this guy who used to go to my church and I said out loud ""we missed hearing Tommy sing"" as if he were in the choir. I looked over at him as I said this and he was looking at me nodding his head, as if to say ""yes you did"". Then in the  part of the dream I remember being with this one person, people from my church seemed to still be involved. I was hanging out with him and remember him being really sad or depressed about something. This was a guy that went to my church as well . Anyway I remember in the dream that I knew I was having doubts about my faith and really wanted to talk to someone about it, and thought to myself that he was probably having doubts too and that I could discuss it with him. Although I never got around to that. Then I remember that he and I decided we were going to go to my house and hang out, I also remember thinking to myself that we would have sex or do something intimate. We left but then somehow we were no longer together. I then remember my mom suddenly being in my dream and her and my dad were going to go on some bus tour. I was standing on the sidewalk and looked down the block and could see them getting on the bus together. Then I got on another bus to meet my friend Chyrise. She was on the bus and I sat down to talk to her and told her about Kory . That's about all I remember. Ironically enough, he and I never did make it back to my apartment and nothing intimate happened, go FIGURE!!!!"
151,"Ok this dream I remember a few bits and peices. At one point I went to the doctor's office with a friend because he had to get a shot, probably for allergies. There was a girl before him who got one and we could see the mark where the shot had been given and it was right in her neck, we thought that was odd since it's supposed to be in your neck. I think he then got his shot. I remember this other part where I was walking with this guy. He was walking forwards and it was like I was laying on the ground looking up at him, but obviously I was moving with him as he walked not sure how, but I was looking up at him. Then we look up at the sky, it's night. And all of a sudden it was as if a backdrop filled with stars was filling the sky. Almost as if someone had dropped an enormous sheet over the sky. We were all looking up at it in amazement. That's all I remember."
152," Okay, I had a dream that I was at this place, I was with this group. I must have still been in Spain because we were speaking Spanish sometimes. I’m kind of stuck on that. And we were going to see somebody ice skating or rollerblading or doing some kind of tricks like that. And we were on rollerblades ourselves, and we were hurrying up to this place. And then we jumped on these escalators that go twice as fast as regular ones do. And so then they started, we like jumped on these escalators and they go really fast up, and then we arrived at the top and there was this ramp. And I couldn’t stop my, I sat down on the edge of the ramp and I couldn’t stop my feet from rolling down into the ramp. They were like hanging off into the middle of the floor there. And then I think I had another dream. I think we were there too early so we couldn’t see the show then. Then I had another dream that I was at dinner and we were eating, eating, eating these things. I had just finished a course, and already this Spanish guy was serving me these things. He had a tray with like six compartments and he had to take these two spoonfuls … . This is a horrible tape! "
153,"This was one short. I remember  of us were in separate elevators. Well they were kinda like elevators. It was more like we were in a small elevator shaft cuz you could see all the wires and cables. We had the ability to make the elevator drop extremely fast, and then stop, kinda like a ride at an amusement part. We did this several times and I could actually feel the sensation of dropping, it was fun."
154,"This dream started with me sleeping in my bed. My  cats were on my bed and I then felt another animal or something walking across my bed. But for some reason I couldn't see clearly what it was. Then I remembered that one of my cats had been missing  and figured it was that cat. I started calling for Roscoe  and there he appeared. He is an orange persian, but in the dream he was shaved, he only had hair on his head and tail. I remember in real life I had to do this once because his fur got all matted. Anyway there I was with my  cats. The other  cats were not the cats I have in real life, they were some other cats, one was extremely large. Then I hear my mother in the hallway outside my apartment and remember she is coming by to visit. So I try to clean up really quick. I deliberately shut my bedroom door because that is extremely messy. I get cleaned up . I open the door and she walks in with my aunt and uncle  and some other guy. The other guy makes a b-line for my bedroom and goes in. I follow him back there and tell him to get the hell out, my uncle is in there as well. Finally after much yelling he leaves my bedroom and I shurt the door. Then everyone is sitting on the floor in a circle. I wanted to show them all my cats, who were in the bedroom, so I went and got them. While in my bedroom I notice someone had picked up and stacked all my clothes and my floor was clean, odd. I come back out with the cats and my uncle picks up the big one and starts petting him, and he begins to do a soft roar like a lion would. I tell him I have never heard him roar before. Then I notice my bedroom door is open again. My aunt is in there cleaning up my bedroom and rearranging the furniture. This infuriates me because I told everyone to stay the hell out. I ask her what she is doing to the point that I am almost in tears and extremely stressed out. She finally comes out of my bedroom and tries to justify her actions, I remember telling her it's a matter of respecting MY WISHES. My mom agreed with me. Then a guy comes out of the closet and gives my mom a cup of coffee and then went back in to the closet and disappeared. THe phone then rings and I got to answer it. I pick up and someone is saying ""Tide, Tide, Tide""  to me, I saw ""Whatever, Bye"" and they say Bye and I hang up. Finally my mom mentions she wants to by the condo next door for $,. Then they all left. That was it."
155," Last night I dreamt that I was at school already, that I was in homeroom and we had to fill out these forms which they called “desk-writing forms” that told your GPA last year and some information about yourself, and that they were going to grade us on that. And somebody was showing me mine from last year and I couldn’t really read it. It was like diagrammed out, though. And then we were watching some kind of a movie, and then Elizabeth came and looked at me and said, “Let’s go.” And then I’m riding in a brown car with her, with brown seats in it. And we go to this restaurant and we’re ordering this steak burger thing and all of a sudden she disappears, she takes off. And then I woke up."
156," Last night I had a dream that Sheryl and Sandra and Sam were in town, and that Ryan was over, and we were all sitting in the living room with Dad and talking about something; I don’t remember exactly what. I seem to recall having a similar dream before. And Dad was sleeping and Sheryl and Sandra and Sam and I were all out at the park, and I was carrying the silvery portable boom box down, and I was going to put it somewhere. And I was sitting on the couch with it, and I was playing a tape of sound effects that I recorded. And then I remembered that Dad was sleeping and I figured I’d better take it back upstairs. And then I said to Mom, “I’m getting my exercise hauling this thing up and down the stairs.” And then all of a sudden I was under the water with a plastic bag and supposedly I could hear Sebastian and Ursula’s eels, and then I woke up."
157,"Just remember a bit. At one point myself and  friends  were hanging out. We were trying to score some pot. Then I remember we came back to my house  and the girl that was with us had gotten drunk. She was laying in the bed in the room my mom would have used. I was pissed because she is the one that knew the ""pot contact"" and that we wouldn't be able to hook up. The guy that was with me decided to call the ""contact"" and he wasn't even there. I remember there was some driving in the dream as well but don't remember much else."
158," I had a dream last night that I discovered this tape , that we were at a little house that we were staying with Mrs. Hammondin and two other students, and I discovered this tape that I just described. And I put it in a boom box, and I started playing it, and it had “Battle Hymn of the Republic” and a couple of other patriotic songs on it, but it was totally different than what I just described it to be. That was strange."
159,"Only part of the dream I remember is I was walking to my car, and lady that I used to go to church with, back in my christian days, was sitting in a car and yelled my name. I turned around and saw her. She got out of the car and walked over. We hugged and talked for a minute, I gave her my number and we said we would keep in touch. I was surprised she didn't ask me why I was going to the church anymore. That's all I remember."
160," Last night I had kind of a disturbing dream. This was the day after my first day of school. I dreamt that Dad was kind of crabby and that he was in Mom’s workroom and I whispered to Mom something or other and somehow he heard it. And somehow he heard it and then he came in and started disconnecting the wires to my sound system, and I said, “What are you doing?” and then he made some kind of smart alec remarks and he said, “I’m not worth anything to you.” And then I said, “Well, think of all our walk time, all our family time.” And he said, “Family time? Yech!” And then I said something, I yelled something and then I slammed the door behind me and I ran out with Mom to go to the Thai restaurant with the firemen people. I think this dream was brought on be a subconscious overreaction to his teasing last night about I didn’t use his binder and so he was teasing about he’s just an old bird these days. Now I remember something else about that dream. After Mom and I walked out, we went to Circuit City and I think she was tell me she dropped something, and she was going to have to pay for it. I don’t remember exactly. "
161,"Ok let me try to tell ya what I remember. I was going on some trip with a whole bunch of people. We were going to Zaire I think and then from there we were going to fly off to another solar system and check out this new planet. Not sure why. At one point I was at my mom's house, in my old bedroom, trying to figure out what I was going to take on the trip. My mom was going to. For some reason there was this gift I was going to bring w/ me for my Aunt Mary. It was this huge box, already wrapped. Then I decided I would give her something else for the time being so I didn't have to bring this big ass box. I got some sweater and remember trying to find a box to put it in. Then we were all in this hotel and we were going to meet to go on this trip. There was this HUGE limo waiting outside to pick us all up. There were a few people from my job going on this trip too. I hopped in the limo and got mad because I couldn't sit next to my mom, or she didn't want to sit next to me, something like that. Then I remembered I had not called my cat sitter so I told the limo to go ahead and I would catch a cab to the airport. Guess I didn't have my cell phone. Here is where the dream got really frustrating. I go back inside and now I am in my apartment. I called information to get the number for my cat sitter. I told her the name of the company and she couldn't find it. I was mad because I had been able to get the number several times before. Finally I hung up walked out of my apartment to the information desk outside. They were the same people that answer the  calls. So I asked for a supervisor and told him the number I was trying to find. It seemed a very difficult task. We were walking around and he was asking me questions, almost to verify that I really needed the number. I remember telling him the name of my cat sitter and that seemed to be enough information where he was going to give me the number. Yet he still didn't give it to me. At this point a guy at the desk asked if the cab should keep waiting and I said yes. I was afraid I was going to be late for the airport. I got REALLY pissed at this point, so much so that I sighed very loudly. I obviously sighed for REAL because it was so loud I woke up mid-sigh  and heard myself. I felt very stressed when I awoke. That's all I remember."
162,"Ok I know this dream was long, but I don't remember much. Had another dream I woke up during earlier, and don't remember any of that either. In one part of the dream I am driving this little car. Someone was in the car with me. Then I come to this intersection. There was a median in the middle of the  lanes and in order to go right you need to get on the right side of the median . But somehow I missed it and had to back up. Then when I tried to go forward I couldn't . Then this cop or someone comes up and I try again and was able to go. Ok let me try to describe the setting of this next part. I seemed to be in some city. It was dark. The part of the city I was in had this wall, probably  feet tall. On top of the wall it was wide enough to walk. If you were standing on top of the wall there was a chain link fence that went up about another  feet. So I am walking along on top of this wall holding on to the chain link fence. Along comes the actor James Spader. We talked and then either he, or I, asked where the bathroom was located and then we came upon what looked like a portable bathroom. Although I don't remember use it. Another part of the dream there was this guy. No clue who. He had dark long hair and maybe an accent, I remember him being from another country. At one point I thought he was fine then suddenly he asked me if he could borrow money, and I didn't feel right about it. I asked him what for, and he said ""Air Fare"". Then other people seemed to be around us calling him a theif or telling me he was. He then walked off and was over talking to some friend of his, unaffected by what just happened. That's all I remember."
163,"I don't remember a lot about this dream. All I know is my mom and I were in a plane. At one point in the dream our part of the plane was falling towards earth. I remember us looking out and seeing a beautiful island and the ocean, rocks, etc. We hit the ground and seemed fine and got out and there was a ship there waiting for us. That's all I remember. When I woke up I found out that the Singer Aaliyah had died in a plane crash in the bahamas saterday night. Freaky and very sad, I really liked her. I am sure she is moving on to even better things!"
164," Last night I had strange dreams. I dreamt that, first of all, we were on the nature trail and we were walking along looking at different things – Mom and me and my sisters, Sheryl and Sandra, and Sam. And we were showing pictures in the picture album; we took a few more pictures. And then we came home, we stopped on the way home at like a big service merchandise store thing. And we looked around and we bought something that was like a DVD player, and some other boxes looked at it and then we decided we were going to buy it. So anyway, we bought it, and we got home and immediately when we brought it home, it was a VCR, and I took it out of the box and hooked it up to the amplifier as if I’d done it a hundred times, like I do with the the board. Then I took the closest video tape that I could find and put it in there to check it out, but I didn’t even turn on the TV because all I was interested in was the audio. That was weird! And then Dad was coming in and I turned everything off so that he could turn it on and pretend that he was the first one to turn it on. And then I was with Brad and Randy and Mark from Home Improvement, trying to make them work something out, and showing them our family pictures. And then I woke up."
165," I finally remember the dream that I had last night. I’m getting ready as we speak. Anyway, last night I dreamt that it was Christmas time and we were passing out Christmas presents. We had Uncle Carl and Aunt Joyce and Uncle Jack and Aunt Polly and Grandma and Grandpa, and Grandpa was doing the passing. And Carl and Jim and Jack were all little boys, and it was like it used to be. Carl got all kinds of nice things and the other two were real jealous. And before I knew it, somehow – I don’t remember unless we changed scenes – like we were our family and we had all these little things in front of us, and then Dad said, “I’m going to bring the presents out in a little bit,” thinking that it was the big one. And I also dreamt that the magnifying machine in the dining room was a computer and that it was on and I had to hit control-alt-delete because something went really screwy, and then I remembered, and then I woke up."
166,"I only remember a small portion of this dream. My friends and I are sitting around smoking weed out of this pipe. We are outside. Someone mentions the possibility of ""What if a cop comes"". And what do you know we look up and there is a cop. A bald white cop to be exact. I threw the pipe on the ground and before I knew it my friends were gone. The bastards ditched my ass. The cop came over asking me where the gun was. I told him there was no gun, that I threw down a pipe. I think he then found the pipe, but then it seemed like he was accusing me of drunk driving or something. It was odd. The walked away for a few moments and then came back w/ a ticket and gave it to me. It was just this small slip of paper. I asked him if he thought I would get a fine or jail time, and he seemed to think I wouldn't. That's all I remember."
167," Last night I had a dream that I didn’t get up for school until : and then I was rushing around trying to catch the bus, and nobody was here. So I didn’t really have to report to anybody about why I was so late. But anyway, I dreamt that I didn’t have time, I still had time to recover. And then I was at school. I don’t remember the rest."
168,"Ok first dream I remember I was at some hotel and when I woke up the sun was up. I was wondering what time it was because all the clocks indicated it was very late at night, yet the sun was up. The inside of my hotel room looked like my mom's bedroom. I went down to the lobby and saw my boss Pat and  of my co-workers eating at the restaurant, thankfully they didn't see me because I was late for work. It must have been mid afternoon. I then called my boss on his cell phone to let him know I would be late and that I just saw him in the restaurant. That's all I really remember about that one. There was also a reference to Maddog / in this dream. This next dream I had to go to the bathroom . I think I was at my moms house and kept going up to use the rest room. THen I remember being in some other place that didn't have bathrooms and having to go outside, that's always fun. At one point I was gonna go in the bushes and these guys told me not to do it in the bushes over there  because they were marijuana plants and the pee would hurt them. LOL So I sent elsewhere. Finally when I woke up I had to go really bad and made a b-line for the bathroom. Thankfully during the many times I went in my dream my brain realized it was a dream and didn't let me go in real life. I mean I haven't wet my bed since I was  so that would not have been good. *grin*"
169," I had a really strange dream last night. I dreamt that Mom and Dad were in Canada, and they were going to drive down and come and get me and go back to the cabin and they did. And Mom drove down, and she said that Dad was waiting at the cabin and we were trying to get stuff together, and she was looking for her little personal tape player unit, and she couldn’t find it. So we just started out the door and we started driving, and all of a sudden Dad appeared in the passenger seat. Now I remember. We were driving to the cabin, and we got to the cabin and Dad stressed the importance of being quiet and stuff. And some force made me turn on the sound equipment, it happened to be in a room in the cavern that looks just like my workroom, and I couldn’t turn it off. I clicked the power switch off, but the sound was still blasting at full level. So then I had to stop the CD player and try and turn it off. Last night I had a funny dream. First of all I dreamt that I was in the Devil Vision room with Elizabeth and we were going to take a test in there for some reason. And we were coming out and the librarian sees us coming out and she comes to talk to us. And Elizabeth is teasing and she says “Yeah, that’s Jasmine, messing up your room in there.” And then we go out a back door and we’re in this field thing, and then I’m with Mom, and I was trying to find a place to practice my song for chorus and not have anybody listening. I’m tired; can you tell?  There were these kids around and so I can’t. I stand up on this tall thing and I start singing, and then all of a sudden I’m in this church and I’m auditioning in front of Mrs. Dougherty and Mr. Henderson. And they give me a song that’s completely out of my range and I keep screwing up and stuff. And I have a microphone and the board is right behind me and I’m trying to adjust things to make me sound a little bit better. Then I woke up."
170," I had a dream that I was staying at somebody’s house out at the beach, and we were watching The Little Mermaid movie, and it felt like I was right there. And it was a little different than the usual story really is because, first of all, there were only a few events in it. Eric and her had a few more dates before they got married, and King Triton was never in the scene. And she stayed a mermaid while she was up on land with him. It was just so weird, so strange, so different. And after the movie was over, I woke up."
171," Last night I had a dream that I was going to attend a Little League baseball game with Kristen Hollander and Mr. Owen and Mrs. Dougherty, and I was taking a bus to school at like : at night. And I got on the bus and I realized that I didn’t have any shoes on, but then I looked down and I saw my sandals, so I put my sandals on. And I got to school and I was walking in the hallway and it was almost dark, and I realized that they were going to not like me wearing my sandals, so I was going to call Mom on the pay phone to bring them and to give me my other shoes. And I just thought about them and they were on my feet and I didn’t have to call Mom after all. Later we walked out to the football field and it was real cold and there were several little fires going. And there was one that was almost burned down, and I put my hand in the embers to get a little statue of a parrot out of there, and it didn’t burn me at all, it only tingled a little bit so I figured I’d better get away from here before the teacher sees me sticking my hand in the fire. And then, after I pulled the statue of the parrot out, it started burning big again, and Mrs. Hammondand Mrs. Dougherty and I sat down on the bench in front of it to keep us warm, because it was cold. And Mrs. Dougherty’s voice was getting lower and lower, and I was really afraid that she had been hurting it yelling at the class, which she never did."
172,"Ok bits and pieces of this LONG dream, I think it was multiple dreams because I woke up a few times. Ok in one dream I was at work and there was this guy caught in an elevator at our job. It was some new electronic elevator and no one could figure out how to get him out. They needed the key that I had, at least at one point. I had no idea where the key went. However, I really wanted to find it so I could ""save the day"". I was searching all over my bedroom for this key and I finally found it and was able to let him out of the elevator. He had been in there like  days. Everyone was happy that I saved him. Then I remember another part of the dream where we were all taking part in this play but it was real life, meaning we had to play these characters in everyday life. I wasn't with that and pretty much didn't comply. I also remember my mom was going to have some kind of party and a lot of kids were going to come and they were all going to sleep in my bedroom and I would sleep in the guest bedroom. I remember going into my bedroom and there was this little kid, he was the size of an infant but infact  years old, suffering from some illness. He was totally concious and aware of what was going on. So I picked him up and brought him to my room  and we talked and watched tv and stuff. Then later in the dream he was back to normal size and back in school. He was still sick and quite weak though. I asked him how things were going and he said ""Okay"" but mentioned that fact that some kids were teasing him. THen there was this kid over by his locker who he wanted to talk to and therefore I got his attention. I tapped him on the shoulder and he turned around and I introduced my little friend and myself. THen my little friend threw up right there in front of everyone. The kid who we had tapped on the shoulder was very cool about it and didn't tease him or anything. The last part of my dream I am in my car and the lead singer of Green Day was outside my car, next to me, on a bike I think. Next thing I know he was on the ground. I opened my car door and he was unconscious, laying right there. I got out, and so did another guy from another car, to see if he was alive. He was. Suddenly he opened his eyes and seemed a little out of it. He was having trouble getting up so I helped him up to his feet. He stood there for a minute kinda dazed and then finally knew where he was. I told him I loved his band and their music. I asked them where their next concert was and he said at the ""University of New Orleans"". THen he gave me a hug and I woke up."
173," I had a dream last night that I was in a hospital for some reason. I didn’t feel like I was hurt or sick or anything, but for some reason I was in a hospital. And Elizabeth was in the hospital. I think she was either in the hospital or visiting me. But there were two rooms that we got to roam around, and one of them was my room and it was like all messed up with other people’s junk. And I don’t remember if it had one or not, but the other room had a radio that was kind of falling apart, and it was turned on and I couldn’t figure out how to turn it off. It had a CD player top thing to it, but the lid came off. And things were just all falling apart on it. And eventually I got it to shut off somehow. And then I was talking to her about what would we do if we ever had a fire drill in here, and then this message came over the intercom that they were going to have one. But here’s the funny thing: the funny thing is that the fire alarm sound was going to be like frog’s croaking, and that was how there were frogs croaking outside when I woke up."
174," Last night I had a dream that I was at a boarding house somewhere. I thought it was somebody’s birthday. And before we celebrated the person’s birthday, we had to have everybody put their bags up on the table and have a writing essay thing as to describe somebody’s bag that you think is neat. And I started out and before I knew it, it was Sandra’s birthday, I think, and we had presents for her and she had presents for us. And we were going giving her her presents, and she was giving us ours, but I woke up before we could open them."
175," I had a dream last night that I had multiple handicaps and that I couldn’t hold in my bladder, and that I had to wear pads all the time for if I had to go pee. And I would just have to let it go. And later I dreamt that I was at school in Mrs. H.’s room and we were doing something, and I had to put my book bag somewhere, so I went in the auditorium and I put my book bag down. And the auditorium had no seats in it; it was just a big room. And then I heard Mr. Vincent’s class coming and I went in the closet and closed the door. I didn’t want him to see me. And then I figured it was just his students and it was safe to come out. Then I came out and got out and told Elizabeth that I had wet in the closet. And then I dreamt that I was in my room, in my bedroom with somebody – two other girls – and I was playing a destiny’s Child CD, but somehow we could see them singing and performing. And they said, “Don’t they have strange outfits on?” And I said, “Yeah,” because one of them had a table as a hat and a black and white dress."
176," I am with my old platoon in Cambodia on LZ Ranch. We are pressed up against the berm. An attack is coming. My M- is broken. There is no trigger or clip. A sergeant offers me his weapon, but I refuse, saying he is the better soldier. I help to invent a catapult that hurls a half dozen grenades at a time. However, the device is faulty. Ed W. uses it to initiate the attack. The scene changes. We are in a village. An old VC hides in a hut hoping to escape. I throw him down and sit on him. He is taken prisoner, but will not speak. I devise a way to torture him. We dig a vertical hole, bury him up to his neck, then place a clear plastic cover over his head. We will urinate on him. But the VC is stubborn and will not speak. He accepts that he will die. Then there is shooting and we rush for cover. I find a Viet Cong who resembles Richard B., my best college friend. He attempts to steal American weapons from a display, but grabs an umbrella instead. I tell him to give up. When he refuses, we fight. Each time I stab his belly he says, “Kill me.” I feel terrible. It is as if I knew this man. When he weakens, I take him in my arms and call for help. His stomach leaks on me. I am crying. I am saying, “Oh God…. Oh God.” American soldiers arrive. They look perplexed and awed. We march to a hospital. "
177,"Oh yeah had my  lucid dream. It's about dang time! Well I was dreaming a normal dream. I was at my house, of course it wasn't my house. And I looked up and saw something in the sky, my cat saw it too. It was falling towards us and my cat ran out to investigate. It looked like a box of cereal with something hanging from it. The cat caught it and brought it to me . I looked at the thing hanging from the box and it said I had won $,. It had a number to call and some extension I had to punch in. I remember it being a  digit extension starting with a . I was asking myself ""Is this real or am I dreaming, this can't be real, I must be dreaming"". One would THINK i would have become lucid right there, nope. I went inside to call this number and of course, as in most dreams, had a difficult time doing that, couldn't exactly figure out what the number was nor could I remember it when I was trying to dial it, another sure dream sign. At some point soon after I came to the conclusion that I must be dreaming, then it hit me for real, ""OH wait I'm DREAMING!"" Suddenly everything went black, I thought I was going to wake up but held on for dear life. Then I was walking but everything was still black. I got the idea to try to fly, even though I could see nothing. I jumped off the ground and felt the sensation of flying, at first it felt like I was falling but I quickly changed that. I felt wind hitting me and I was turning over while I was flying too just to see what it felt like. Then it appeared I woke up, although I am guessing I didn't really. And I thought to myself, SHIT, go back in the dream, and then I had this overwhelming of being sucked back into the dream immediately it was very odd. Then I remember I was suddenly in this large house. Still aware I was dreaming. I was telling myself I want to see SOMEONE, anyone. And then I was like how about Sully from Godsmack. HA :) I walk into this huge room and he is sitting there in this chair but I can't really SEE him. I do remember the house was very large as were the rooms. Very antique looking. That's all I really remember about the dream, but was very cool that I became lucid and actually held on to the lucidity for a while."
178," The morning when Mom and Dad are supposed to leave town. It’s : this morning, so I sound a little distant. Last time I had a dream that Mrs. Dougherty was in Spanish class, and that she was going to teach us to sing “The Star Spangled Banner,” which was very appropriate. And Mrs. Dougherty comes over and sits besides me, and she said that she saw me in AP Spanish, which I really am not but in my dream I was, and that I should translate “The Star Spangled Banner” into Spanish while they were doing a staff writing sheet so that I could get some AP credit. And so I started in, and I can recall that I did it perfectly. I started with the first line, “Oh say, can you see, y puedes ver”  and I was having a little trouble fitting, “by the dawn’s early light, con la loof temprana de amanese ” into the melody. And I was really struggling with that. And later on there was something about Elizabeth driving the Mustang with somebody in it, but I don’t remember for sure what that was about. One other thing about this dream that I had, when I was translating “The Star Spangled Banner” and I could hear Whitney Houston singing it in my head, I started crying a little bit because I had such sympathy for my country and all, in my dream, of course. But I still had a tear in my eye when Mrs. Dougherty came over to talk to me again, and she thought that I was disappointed because everybody else got to hear it and I didn’t. Oh, it was funny!"
179," I had a whacky dream last night. I dreamt that we were at school – Elizabeth and I – and I was running out of the Media Center full speed ahead and tumbling and rolling, hoping that I could get out of there before they caught up with me because I didn’t want to do what they wanted me to do. And then I came back in because I knew I had left them in the dust and I didn’t want to leave them in the dust, so I came back in. I bumped face to face into the librarian and she started telling me how, she was like, “Elizabeth told me your Dad’s back-up alarm scared you when you were little, and I understand you’re afraid of ‘oo’ sounds and my name has ‘oo’ in it.” You know, I never thought about that consciously. That’s weird. Ooo-oo-ooh. But anyway, then when we were at the fire headquarters, and I was supposedly playing a computer game in virtual reality and I was running up the stairs with this like three-quarters of a birdcage that I was holding onto. And it was around my body and I was like holding it up. And I bump into Sharon and George Wilson, and they start saying, “Oh hey, how are ya? And how’d you like the trip up to the river, and all?” And then I woke up."
180," I had a weird dream last night! I dreamt that I was going to show Mom where the Devil Vision room is, and it was supposedly in the Birch Building. And it was past the bathrooms and now, in my dream, it was turned into somebody’s bedroom, almost like a hospital room, only it was really pretty decorated. And I asked the librarian, “Where is it this year?” and she handed me a set of keys and led me down this set of stairs in like a cellar in the Birch Building. And then before I knew it, the steps led to outside. And she lifted this cover off the ground and showed us a little panel about twelve inches long and about six inches wide with just two or three knobs on it and said, “This is our panel. This is what we use. This is the extent of our equipment now.” And she lifted another cover and there were these mint candies in that cover, and I took a handful. And she lifted another cover and there were cinnamon candies, little green ones. And then I woke up. That was strange."
181,"Ok I TRULY don't remember a lot of DETAIL about last nights dream. I do remember that there were people out to kill me. Actually it was weird, there was a group of us and it was almost as if we were all out to kill one another, but of course I don't remember anyone actually getting killed. Not sure why I remember absolutely no detail about the dream, but only the theme, that's not normally for me. But oh well. "
182,"Ok this dream was pretty interesting. The first thing I remember is I'm walking to this building and I see my friend Emmett out in the parking lot talking to some other people. I called his name and walked over. He was telling me I was trying to score some weed, I mentioned that I couldn't help because I didn't have my car with me, but to call me later. I walk into this building and go into this room, it's a huge room with a bunch of work cubicles and tables... I stopped to go into the bathroom and found a purse on the floor. I picked it up and the name giggles was on it . I opened the purse up to see if it was hers and found her license in it. I left the bathroom and went to look for her. I remember thinking to myself that her husband was pregnant . I found them sitting at this one table, it was almost as if they lived there, so did a lot of other people. Anyway I gave her, her purse and she thanked me. Then I sat down next to her husband Marty, who was kinda leaning back stretched out. Some other girl was there visiting too. I put my hand on his stomach to feel the baby. Then I told him, ""Can men actually get pregnant? How exactly is this possible"". He went on to explain it to me but I am CLUELESS as to what is explanation was. Then I said something to the affect that if other men had been successful at having babies I am sure he would to. I left them and suddenly it appeared, even though I was in the same room, that I was at my old place of employment when I worked at HUD. Half of the room was filled with the kinda desks we used to sit at in highschool. You know those desks that are all one piece, chair and table all connected together. The kind that heavy set people always had a hard time with *grin*. The other half of the room was all cubicles. I found my boss, who in this dream is my CURRENT boss in real life, he was NOT my boss when I worked at HUD, but he was in the dream. It was as if I had come BACK to work for them and this was my first day. He basically told me to get situated and start working. So I tried to figure out where I was going to sit. I couldn't find a place so I went back and asked him. We finally decided I would sit at this lady's desk because she had already gone home for the day. Then I told him I would need software in order to be able to work. I needed Photoshop and Cold Fusion Studio. We went to the software closet and got them. When I looked at the Cold Fusion box it said version . on it. I was like, ""This is old as hell"". Then he said ""Look at the side of the box"". On the side it said Upgrade version .. So I'm thinking well why the hell didn't it just say . on the front of the box, that's stupid. I sat down at my desk but don't remember installing the software. I was trying to figure out what I was supposed to do. There were  ladies sitting at the desk behind me talking. I went to my boss and asked him what I was supposed to do. When I worked at HUD in real life we had a system where tasks would be assigned to us and we would login and do the tasks and then close them when we were done. I asked my boss if I had a login yet and he said no, but that I could use Bob's. Who the hell is Bob? I still never ended up getting logged in or doing any work. That's all I remember."
183,"Ok I remember bits and pieces of this one. At one point it seems like myself and a few people from my job were all taking a cab into DC to go to some conference. We got to the hotel and I ended up having to pay for their cab, even though I had taken another cab. Then we are at this hotel and I remember being outside in front of it, there were all these girls sitting in the street. They were in some type of pagent. I remember hearing this announcer explaining the way the girls were sitting. Supposedly the girls at the left end were the meekest of all and as you moved right the girls became more confident. The girls at the far right end were labeled as ""stuck up"" by the announcer. Very odd... That's really all I remember. :) "
184,"Ok in this dream I found a new job, but I was just trying the job out for a day, hadn't actually quit my other job. I show up at this place, it's like one big room with all these desks. The company is owned by this really young guy. It seems they have created an online role playing game and my job will be to help support it. I sit down at this desk, there are  other people there. They all seem cool and we start talking. I ask how much they make, and the girl across from me said about $, a year. I asked if that was the actual salary, she said no the salary was about $, but that the owner of the company always gives them bonuses and perks making the value much more. Damn that's some kinda perks... I looked up at the tv and there was this music video it was the guy from Adema  and a girl. The girl in the video was the one sitting across from me. I was like ""you guys are in a band"", wondering why the hell they would be working there. They said yes and that they had a show that weekend but it was sold out, I told them if they got tickets to let me know. Then we all went outside and their was this giant water slide across the street, everyone always went for a quick ride on their break. I hung back and talked to the owner telling him that I could probably make their website a lot better too, he seemed to like that. Everyone comes back in and we all sit down. The owner plays a scene from a Julia Roberts movie and we all had to write some kinda of caption about it. What that had to do with anything, I don't know. I remember I was trying to write the words I WILL and I couldn't seem to write them too clearly . Then some girls came up to me and said they had seen what I had written and it was very good. Then we all had to read what we had written. When my time came I picked up my paper and looked down and there was all this text that I don't remember writing. I start reading it but for some reason  I couldn't read it and finally gave up. There was this other guy there and I asked him how he liked the job, he said it was ok but that he would rather make more money then have all the perks. I had to go to the bathroom and while I was in there these  girls came up and peeked under the stall, and then said something to the effect that they knew me. When I came out we started talking and I was clueless as to who they were. They seemed to imply we went to elementary school together, but when I asked what school they went to it was not the same one I went to. One girl was really short and kinda cute, hispanic looking, the other girl was black. We walked down to what looked like a MINI stadium. I showed them where my seats were for the tickets I had gotten for the Family Values Tour. They were like, ""Wow great seats"". Then I walk back over to this other area and this girl who I used to go to church with named Christine was sitting there. I said ""Hi Christine"" and we hugged. I said something to the affect that the pastor would not be happy that she was here since it was a SECULAR music thing. I don't remember what she said... Then I realized it was about  and I had not called my boss from my REAL job to tell him I wasn't coming in. I was hoping he just hadn't noticed. I start walking towards my mom's house and was trying to think about what I could say to my boss when I called him. I was very stressed over it. I then woke up *for real* and saw it was light out and thought I had overslept. But I hadn't."
185,"Ok this the first dream I have had that has anything remotely to do with what happened on September . In this dream it appears that I was more of an observer than a participant. I remember there were these  people, both were guys, one white, one black. The black guy goes into this high rise with these Plants  and he placed the plants around the building, they had bombs inside. As he was walking by this security agent you could here this little alarm going off almost as if it could detect he was holding a bommb, however no one seemed to notice. He leaves the building and they start walking away from it, although at this point it appears as I am one of them. The building blows up and all this stuff comes falling down. We keep walking and reach the canadian border . The black guy was dressed like a woman and when we walked up to the border and there was a picture of him hanging there  but we got through anyway. Then I remember one of the guys was now a girl and she was feeling guilty for being a part of the bombing and wanted to turn herself in, so she did. I went to the jail to visit her and it was kinda odd cuz it was just like this big ole room. There were a bunch of us there visiting and we all started doing exercises. LOL That's all I remember."
186,"OK not sure where I was exactly, I was outside in what looked like a park. The first part of the dream I don't remember at all. The part I do remember, I'm standing there and we are all getting ready to leave and go somewhere. I am going to be riding with my friends and these  guys. There is a creek below us and suddenly the creek fills up and the water is coming up on the grass, then a huge wave comes and we are now all waist deep in water. Of course in reality there would have been a CURRENT to float us all down the river, but in this case there was none. We were all standing there in the water waiting for our ride. Then we realized the  guys had left without us. Well damn that was not nice. I remembered I had driven and the car wasn't that far away so we walked. The water had disappeared at this point too. Then I remember going to my mom's house so I could ""get ready"", still don't know where we were going. I was looking for a curling iron so I could do my hair, but couldn't find one. That's all I remember."
187," Last night I had a dream that Mrs. Dougherty and the class was over here and they were going to practice, we were going to practice in our living room and give Mom and Dad a concert. And so we were warming up in our living room, and that was neat. And we had this cake that looked like a dollhouse with all these little figures in it, and on top of it and in it and stuff. And I was sitting on the floor of my room cutting it up and putting plates of cake on the steps for everybody. And Gerard got one with a parrot and a dolphin, and Mrs. Dougherty got one with a big bear, and she said, “Make sure I get a plate with french fries.” And so I piled all the french fries to hers. And then we were walking in this restaurant, from table to table holding hands and singing. And we climbed up on this one table and were singing. And my voice was louder and more resonant than anybody else’s. I think I had this dream because I was practicing our songs into the amplifier yesterday, and I went into a sound field that made me sound like I was in a big bathroom."
188," Last night I had a dream that Dad and Mom and I were on a trip and he was telling me things. First of all, he was explaining to me the things in an elevator, and one of them was like a little hatch that you could talk to other people, and another was like – I don’t remember exactly what. But he was telling all these horror stories as to what could happen in an elevator, and how you could like fall ten stories. I was really nervous when we got on the elevator and went down to the ground floor, but we did. And then he wanted me to ride around the perimeter of this garden. First there was a little place where people could go in with a fan blowing out of it, then there was a little pool, then there was the air conditioner and then there was the other side opposite the house. I went around everything he said, but I didn’t go past the air conditioner. So I don’t remember anything more."
189," Last night I had a dream that I was celebrating my birthday in the middle of October. I was trying to show Mom how to draw the amplifier in the living room and how to make the perspective when some people started showing up for the party and I realized that I forgot to call my friends and invite them to the party. But there were people showing up to the house that I didn’t even know. They were really rough teenagers and stuff, and they were bringing presents. And one of them brought me a little church ornament from Spain. I remember I was going to tape the party, so I went up to get the recorder and I put a tape in it and it started making this squeaking noise and that meant it was getting eaten up. And I just put it there and I decided I didn’t have time for that."
190," I dreamed that Kendra and I were going back and forth between her house to my house while Mom and Dad were out of town. First of all we were at her house and she had this beautiful little patio that turned out to be her front yard. And one time while we were running around her house she went in the back room, she did something, and the whole house started to tip on its side like the Titanic ship did. And I was holding on to the stair banister railing and my voice was gone and I couldn’t yell for her. And she said that the guy living here was on drugs and that he was doing that. And then the next thing was that we were over at our house and I was setting up the Halloween game, and there was this one Halloween figure that I had forgotten about. And it was a witch with a little skeleton thing, and the skeleton twirled around and there was a man’s voice that talked in this thing. "
191," I had a strange and eerie dream last night. First of all I dreamt that I was watching “The Little Mermaid” and there was more to it than just the story that they had. And as per usual, my mind keeps making up more details. I dreamt that Triton and Ursula were doing it, and that’s how he got all his princess daughters, and that Ursula was their mother. And after she had Aquada , Triton took her to the, some meeting somewhere to kind of show her how things were done. And she was talking to like a teenager. And then the scary part was when she had Ariel and Triton had Ariel and they came to the part of the movie where he destroyed her human treasures. Instead of singing “Part of That World,” she sang “Blue Bird.” And then the movie ended. And I, oh my gosh. And once Mom was up in my room and there was this dinosaur soap that had broken in half and we called it a Blue Bird soap, and it wasn’t really scary. And then I differentiated between the Blue Bird tape and the Blue Bird soap. That was kind of funny actually. And then she put on this really pretty dress and decided she was going to go to the store, and I told her, “Well, wait a minute. How in the world am I going to do this without you?” because I was getting ready to record something, I don’t remember what. And she said, “We’ll do it as soon as I get back,” and I was like, “Yeah, right.” And then the scariest part. I dreamt that Halloween witch could record people’s voices, and it recorded somebody saying, “If you want to have a dream in the category of “pushed or drawn to danger,” just turn on the radio and play “Blue Bird” and you’ll have your own."
192," I had a dream last night that we were reliving a movie about World War II and that we were doing it at like this park like Adventure Island and stuff. And first Mom and Sheryl and Sandra would go off these steps and I was yelling after them, “No, don’t go that way!” And so then they came down and we were swimming in this pool, and the side of it had these slime plastic spike things that, if you would put your hand on them, you would sink into them and be engulfed in them, your hand would be, and you’d never know what would happen in the pool. And so finally we were out of there somehow and there were all these people and everything. And this people-mover thing, we found out that Sam was now an officer and we were on this people-mover thing and it went to this hotel room. And I was standing like up on a thing looking down at Terri who was in the water, and I had a feeling they were filming a movie or something. "
193," I had a dream last night. I haven’t been able to remember my dreams in a while. But I had one last night, and I dreamt that I had drawn some pictures. One was of a green guy that was supposedly Dad after he slammed on the brakes. I drew a picture of Mother Mary, of another girl, and some other figure – I don’t remember. And Mom had put them in a folder in the computer with a digital camera. She had taken a picture before her and saved it to a folder. And Dad and I were working on some animations that were in a program like a slideshow, like PowerPoint like we used in Mass Media last year, where you click on one and you see one after another after another like a slideshow. And Dad and I were working on adding some animation to that, and adding a piece of MIDI music there and s that they were going to do a remake of the “Titanic.” Oh, before all that, I happened to be riding a bike, the tandem, down the street without the front. But anyway, we were going to remake the “Titanic” movie, and there was this lady going to show it, and she said that she wanted me to sit on the floor right up close because there were going to be kids come and sit behind me, right up close where the TV is and she was going to show some movie about the remake. And next thing I knew, I was down at the sea wall and I was standing on the little ledge down below where we used to jump off of, and there was a boom box on top of the sea wall. And I was getting ready to jump into the water. When I turned around, and I turned the volume of the boom box down some first, and then I jumped in the water and there was this inflatable ionic column floating around in the water that I grabbed hold of, and then I was swimming around and somebody was saying how the main thing in the movie is volume and how to visit their website and all."
194,"Ok this was a weird one. All I remember is I am in this house, it's not my house, some friend of my dad's I think. I believe my dad, my brother and I all came to the house together, my dad drove. I was in this back room trying to get some sleep and I think everyone else was partying. At one point I wanted to go home, and went outside and saw that my dad's car was gone. I went back in and someone told me he'd be back. Then I remember going down to the basement and as I was going down my dad was coming up. I asked him for the keys to the car so I could get my bag because I wanted to leave, was just going to take a cab. He said no, and appeared extremely intoxicated . Somehow I must have gotten the keys anyway and went out to the car got my bag and left."
195," First of all, I dreamt that our Spain group was in the mall again and they want people to go to the food court for some reason, they wanted to stay in a little area. Somehow I got to meet in this big white dome-like area with this black guy, walking beside him, and we were getting on this people-mover thing to get across this area. And for some reason he was talking about that he still had some slaves and that he was one. Let’s see. Then I had another dream. Then I dreamt that Dad and I were up in the sound room doing something, and I don’t remember what we were doing, but all of a sudden we were laying down and he had the remote to the receiver and all of a sudden, “Born to Be Wild” was playing while Mom was vacuuming downstairs and he didn’t seem to mind too much. He was asleep. And “Boom,” the feminist song, started playing and I was hoping that he was still asleep. And then Mom turned on the power suck head of her vacuum cleaner and it was really loud and it sounded really strange, I moved over close to what I thought was Dad and I woke up and found out that it was Mom. The last dream that I had, I dreamt that we were all in a little theater and that I was sitting in a rocking chair in the very, very back of the stage. No, wait. First I was down in the bottom, and somebody called me up on stage and asked me what, what level I was, whether I was the first or second soprano, and I said, “I’m the first.” She put me way in the back in the rocking chair that we have in our living room. And I’m laying there in the rocking chair, almost asleep, while we’re singing and I’m like three half-steps lower than the rest of them, and I can’t seem to be any higher. And it’s Monday night already, and there’s tons of people out there watching us and we’re just not cohesive. Everybody, half the group is talking while the rest of us are singing. Mrs. Dougherty was in this big, white tee shirt with white pants. I’ve never seen her in all white before, but in my dream she was. And another dream I had last night, I dreamt that we were having some kind of a party in the kitchen and Uncle Larry rode up on Mom’s bicycle with his boom box in the basket, blasting. And I knew he was coming because I heard his boom box. And we started talking about sound stuff and all, and then I woke up."
196,"I am in this house. It seems I am going down the stairs and the portion of the stairs I am standing on is outside. Something caused me to look up and I saw a tornado coming towards the house. I started running down the stairs, trying to get to the basement. Suddenly I feel the house lift up and move. I felt the sensation of it flying and then falling to the ground. That's all I remember."
197," This is the next night. I had a dream. I dreamt that we were having a block party and that we were driving around in a car, but first we were walking. And it was this guy’s birthday, and I dreamt the calculator had a graphic equalizer and that I could do math and sing into it at the same time for this guy’s birthday. And then we were driving in the car around the block party site and there were like  kids in line to take a ride on the fire truck. And the sirens were like unusually loud. And then I dreamt that I was laying on a bed with Donya Gloria and my sister and I was just doing impromptu Spanish speech, and Donya Gloria__ covered my face under the covers and then I couldn’t see anybody making hand signals. And then I woke up."
198," Last night I had a dream that we were having a chorus rehearsal and everybody was sitting in the aisle of the little theater. And they wanted everybody to sit down and turn a certain way, but we were all in the aisle. And we started singing, “Deck the halls with boughs of holly, fa la la la la la la la la.” And then we started going faster and faster, and I thought to myself how the words were tripping over each other, and how it got to be tongue twister when we started going faster and faster. And we got to, “Fa la la, la la la, la la la,” I had to go into my own octave, and that happened to be when Mrs. Dougherty was standing right next to me. And I kind of went up a little bit too high, I think. And then suddenly her and I were walking in the park together, like Mom and I do, and she started running and I held onto her one arm with both of my hands and we ran together. She said, “This is good exercise.” And then she, with her other arm, puts her other around me and starts spinning us around and around and around, and then we start just walking again and she yells something, something like, “Didn’t That feel good?” and I say, “Easy, won’t that hurt your voice?” And she didn’t answer. So we kept walking and before we knew it, we were home. And I told her I had to, it happened to be when Mom and Dad were home, and I told her I had to vacuum up some bird seed on the porch. And she said, “Well, let me run home and get my car, and I’ll vacuum for you.” And I said, “No, you don’t have to.” And she said she would vacuum for me. And then I got home and Mom was there, and then I called her and left a message that Mom was already here. I don’t remember what happened after that."
199," I remember a little piece of a dream I had last night. I dreamt that, I keep having dreams about chorus and Mrs. Dougherty lately – what is the deal with me? Anyway, I dreamt that I was going to make a – hold on – I dreamt that I was going to make a compilation CD with all of our songs on it, all of our accompaniment. And I was sitting down to make it, and it was like : at night, and I figured I’d better hurry just in case. And so I called what I thought was the, it was called the radio phone line for some reason, and it led into the Drama and Band Department. And Mr. Vincent answered, and I was really a befuddled buffoon as to what to say. I thought at least Mr. Hartley would answer. And then I woke up."
200,Horrible nightmares of the damask curtain transforming to creatures like demons from Hell threatening me. I was so afraid I couldn’t close my eyes with night after night of shear terror!
201,"I have “forgotten” my baby, now I’m trying to find it but I have shit all over me including my glasses so I can’t see. I find it, it feels cool and I thump it in my hand , but I can’t see anything. I don’t know whether it’s dead or alive. “They” come and take the baby away from me but I don’t know if I’m ‘guilty’ of abusing it or it me! I can’t see; I don’t know anything. How could I have forgotten my baby! Darts are hitting me and sticking in me but I can’t see to defend myself! I don’t know where they are coming from!"
202," I had three dreams last night, but I can only remember two right now. The other one might come to me later. The first one was really bizarre. Dad bought me this mixer thing, meaning a cake mixer, not a sound mixer. And it was this round ball thing with a handle on it that you would mix around in this big vat container, and this motor would run and make a vat container for some reason. And he brought me this set of stuff because he thought I would like to mix up concoctions and things. And, oh yeah, I was standing at the kitchen counter mixing some chocolate batter and all the food was on top and all the bits of chocolate were on the bottom, and I tipped the container over when I was mixing it, and the motor was running underneath the container, I guess keeping it warm or something. And I dropped the mixer ball and it somehow goes down the drain and the motor starts doing funny things. And I told Dad and he called the company, hoping they can come out here and take it out, but there was still another mixer ball, but it wouldn’t work if the other one was stuck in the drain. That was bizarre. "
203," And the other dream was that we were in the hotel that was being evacuated, being moved out, and we had a room on the second floor. And Dad was off doing something, and Mom and I – I’m cold, hold on. It’s October the  and winter’s setting in. Okay, but anyway, Dad was off doing something and it was Mom and I, and we were coming down in an orderly fashion out of the hotel and standing in the parking lot without a bag or anything. And we saw a separate building with an elevator in it next door, and we thought about going up the elevator to get all the way to the top, to the sixth floor, but we never did. And oh yeah, now the first dream came to me all of a sudden. I dreamt that we were coming home in Elizabeth’s Mustang, her and I, and I was sitting in the back with my book bag because on the bus I sit right behind the driver, so I sat with my book bag in the back. And I don’t remember her having the sound system or anything on, but she said she wanted me to sit in the back because I was so heavy. I don’t remember; I’m sure there was more to it, but I can’t remember. "
204,"I am aware that I am in a flat, a dark flat with other abandoned children."
205,"Later going downstairs into a girls’ bedroom. It is very attractive, decorated with a “Benetton” theme--even silver Benatton sneakers that seem to move as they play/sing a theme song. The front of the shoes opened like lips and merrily sang. Everything looks very well cared for—pampered. A very well kept room of a young woman who appears to have it all—at least she does a lot of shopping going by the open boxes and new clothes lying around. I hear water running—the shower. I walk to the bathroom and there are  white plastic tubs with wet clothes soaking and a young woman lying on the floor of the white tile shower with  running onto her and there is a feint tinge of pink  swirling around her and in the water of the tubs. That is the only color in the room: that pale pink tinge and her long dark hair. She is as white as the tile; the life seems to be ebbing out of her. She barely opens her eyes and looks at me. “Can you help me,” she pleads. She thinks she is going to die, but I know she is not. The/her bleeding has taken over her life. There is almost no life left in her—everything is pale."
206,"This one was interesting. Ok at one point I am at my mom's house. We are walking up to her house, it appears to be night time. There is this man standing outside her house . It appears to be someone she knows. He was older and had long grey hair pulled back into a pony tail. She used his name, but I don't remember what it was, and told him to leave. The next thing I know he has followed us into the house. She asked him to leave again, I got the impression he might be homeless, but I didn't feel that he was a threat. Next part of the dream I am in my condo and my mom had painted the walls for me. Instead of just one color they were these INCREDIBLY BEAUTIFUL murals of some type of landscape. It was breathtaking to say the least. Next I remember this cute dark haired guy came by my house  and picked me up, we were going on a date. We were going to walk to the movie theater it was just down the street. Suddenly it starts to rain. I held my hands over my head, as if that would block the rain, but I did it anyway. I was still getting wet. I looked to see if there was a cab near by, one passed by but didn't see us. Then we walk by these kids  and they saw me with my hands over my head so they all did the same thing, I just laughed. We got to the end of the block and were at this big city intersection. The guy I was with saw a cab and opened the door and jumped in, at the same time the Lady Cab driver was saying, ""No I'm off duty"". So he got out. This cab was EXTREMELY small, looked smaller then a yugo, the kind of tiny cars you see in France, etc. So we got to the theater and ironically it changed to where we were watching a video while laying on my bed. He was giving me a back massage as we watched. How nice. That's all I remember."
207,"Ok this one was strange, what dream isn't. Only certain parts stand out. The first part I am with some girl and we are hiking down this big hill, it was a very wooded area. We get to the bottom and I look up and there are these HUGE, and i mean HUGE, Hippos drinking water out of the lake. We are talking Hippos the size of someone's house. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I told her I had to go get my camera. To get up the hill, because it was so steep, we had this line that we attached ourselves to and it would pull us up, I started going up and remember getting scared. That's all I recall about that part of the dream. Next I am in my condo, the one I live in now. I hear someone yell my name out the windo and it was one of my mom's old friends. I was like ""Shit what is she doing here"", she said something to the affect that my mom told her and some other people to meet at my house. Why would she do this she KNOWS my house is a mess. *See in REAL life I am not the neatest person, granted not dirty just messy. My mom on the other hand is VERY neat so I rarely like her to come over because I know in her mind she will wonder how I can live in such a messy house , so I tend to dream about it from time to time, in the dream my house is always much messier then it REALLY is*. So I am freaking out, next thing I know there is a knock at my door, it's my mom and some friends of hers, I am like NO, you all need to turn around and walk out of here. They all did except my mom. She was standing there talking to me. Then I remember they left and I walked downstairs to meet them outside and suddenly my mom went into my condo. She had a key. My condo has a key to the BUILDING and then a key to my apartment. In the dream all my mom had was the building key yet for some reason I worked on my door as well and she was able to get in. This disturbed me and I remember thinking in my dream that it was time to change the locks. Next part of the dream. I am down the street at my friend Tammy's house waiting for her. Then I go outside for something, and then go back to her house, and as I am standing in front of her door this van drives by that says ""Disney World Police"" so I just kinda stand there til the pass, then I go inside, I yell ""Tammy?"" and an old woman looks up from the kitchen table saying I was at the wrong house. I realized Tammy was next door. I go out the back and run into some people, as I am walking around to the front of the house this kid starts walking with me. I asked him if he liked Peanut Butter, he says yes, I asked if he liked chocolate, he said yes, then I tell him that he would LOVE reeses peanut butter cups *ironically I had some before going to sleep*. The final part of the dream I am somewhere and I am trying to find my car, yet I can't remember if I had actually driven there or not and realize the car could potentially be at home, so I head home to fine out, then I woke up."
208," I had two dreams last night. This is the day after Halloween. I dreamt that I was at lunch and I was eating my chicken Polly, and Elizabeth was telling all about how it’s processed and cut and made and made all this stuff, and I was just going, “Ewwww,” and I just wanted to spit it out after she told me everything that happened to it. And then I woke up with a start. "
209," And then I went back to sleep and I had another dream. I dreamt that in chorus we were at this like big picnic in Straw Park, this field trip thing. And I was with a girl, Laura, and she was helping me get my lunch and stuff, after I finished eating, Dad was showing me this metal board with stuff on it that was supposed to make scary sounds like, for example, there was this little truck that rides on the metal board. And when it goes forward, it doesn’t do anything, but when it goes backwards, it makes the back-up alarm sound. And there were these ambulances things and stuff that would ride around the perimeter, and then Mrs. Dougherty was busy running around doing things. But then we were in our kitchen and Dad was questioning Mrs. Dougherty about the way she teaches, and she’s defending herself. And Mom says, “Why does it matter, who cares?” And he said, “Well, even better if people are trying to contribute,” and he goes in the bedroom, and her grade book happens to be sitting on the bed in the bedroom. And he looks through her grade book and he sees that she does actually have an orderly way of keeping things. And there’s these CD’s, these really flimsy CD’s that are bigger than normal CD’s that are running there and then we go around and we do different things, and we were talking about going to this restaurant, and then it’s dark and we’re on our porch and Mrs. Dougherty suddenly appears there, and she was talking about how she was thinking of doing this certain song. And I told her about the Blue Bird thing and I held her hand and I sang “Blue Bird” for her and then I woke up."
210," I had a dream that I had a little car to help me practice driving before I actually got a normal-sized one. It was like the size of a go cart and it had no top. It was kind of junky, but it was alright, I guess. And one time I started it up and drove it down to the end of the alley and turned around and drove back. And another time I started it up and went to -Eleven, and then I left it in the -Eleven parking lot and I was walking around and I took a walk around the lake and as I was walking home from the lake, something strange happened. Oh no, I think I got home from the park first. This guy came to the door with this dog, which he called Squirrely and I just got this terrible feeling in his presence, I thought, “Ooohhhhhhh,” so I went in the house, but he came on the porch. And I went in the kitchen, but he came there. Then I took off out the back door and down the alley, and he like chased me around the neighborhood and then I got into the house and he was gone; thank goodness. Then I woke up."
211," It is the present and I am with Bao Ninh in Vietnam. He leads me about, showing me different sites and soldiers. There is a certain intimacy, a certain understanding between us all. We communicate without language. At a rehab center I sit with a Vietnamese veteran who sketches pencil drawings. When he sharpens the point by pressing ni into the blunt stub of his lower arm, I wince and offer help, but he declines. He is proud and self-sufficient and this is his way of doing things. In another room I see the drawings of school children. They are colorful, lively, happy. There is no sense of war. "
212," I had two dreams last night. The first one Elizabeth and I were at school and we were supposed to meet the librarian during fourth period for some reason. And fifth period we were going to go and see “Little Thing” or something, and in sixth period we wanted to leave, but she wanted to call Mrs. Dougherty and find out what we were doing that day. But I knew I, we got to fourth period where we got to see the librarian and I was really nervous and all, and we got there and we just talked like normal people do, and before I knew it, we were in a gift shop together looking at things and talking like normal people. And she bought me this sheep pin. I think that this dream occurred because when I was listening to the tape with Grammy on it, she kind of, sort of, remotely sounded similar to the librarian."
213," Second of all, I had a dream that we had two cell phones, two ’ Chevy’s and two clock radios, and one of these two was good and one of these two wasn’t. Our first cell phone, it just died, and so the second one, we had to start using the second one, but we would go into this picnic at Lake Serena Park over the weekend, and we were going to use a baby toy phone for the weekend and not use the good one until we got back. And we had two cars, looked exactly alike. One of them had a couple little things that were here and there, and one that was perfect. And then we had two clock radios. The one that was there was, it wouldn’t display the time any more, but the display would show like little flowers and things instead of the numbers for the time. And it was showing like stuff like a sailing boy would show, and I had to click the parrot thing to tell the time. But we had another good one that was ready to go. I don’t know what all this double imagery means, but a couple years ago I had a dream that there were two Sir Galahads and, even more, I had a dream that there were two of Dad. So I don’t know what all this dreaming in double is about. "
214,"There was more to this dream but I only remembered the end of it. I had gone somewhere, on a trip, and it was time to come back home. I remember suddenly I couldn't find my plane ticket, which meant we would have to get to the Airport REALLY early, especially with all the extra security. Then I lost my cell phone as well. We were trying to find a ride to the airport and I realized I had also misplaced my suitcase, damn! We backtracked and found my suitcase. Then we caught a bus to this one place but still needed to get to the airport. I looked in the pocket of my suitcase and there was my ticket. So we realized we weren't going to have to rush since we wouldn't have to go to the ticket counter. That's all I remember."
215," Last night I had a dream about Halloween. I dreamt that we had just been to the Cracker Barrel and that Mom and Dad bought three mechanical things. One was a black dinosaur that walked and shook its head, kind of like a Disney mechanical thing. Another was this laughing witch that was this doll thing. And other was a skull, a plastic skull that did things. And I dreamt that I was setting things up, and the kids from down the street were helping me. And before I knew it, they had four tables around me that like boxed me in, like a sound booth person would downtown. And I don’t know, there was really no point to that one. "
216,"Ok my bathroom flooded once in real life since then I have had  dreams about it. :) Now before the flood part started I was in my apartment and I had this bird. It was a really big bird, very pretty, mostly yellow. I put him in a cage while I was cleaning his little area. My cats kept jumping up on the cage and it pissed me off! Anyway next thing I know I go to the bathroom and my toilet was gone. Completely pulled out of the wall, I'm thinking ""how the hell am I gonna go to the bathroom"". I see that there is water on the floor, I look up and water is coming down through the ceiling. I figured maybe the maintence people came in and took it. I yell up at my neighbors and tell them to turn the fucking water off, but I don't think they hear me. Then suddenly these guys are in my apartment. I yell up at my neighbors again and this time they yell something back. Then we see the ceiling is kinda warping as they walk up there. Suddenly a guy from upstairs falls through the ceiling into my bathroom, but he's fine and there isn't even a hole in the ceiling. Then the dream turns and it's my bedroom that is actually flooded and not the bathroom. The water is already about  foot deep and about to hit all the electrical sockets. So we need to unplug everything. First I go to the fusebox to see if I can find the switch for the bedroom but I don't see it. Then one of the guys goes around and unplugs everything. Of course in the REAL WORLD just unplugging stuff wouldn't do much good considering we left the power on. That's all I remember"
217," As you could probably tell, I’ve got this snotty nose you would not believe. Anybody listening to this tape would not want to listen to it. Last night I had a dream about Christmas. I dreamt that it was Christmas already, and we were up in my relative’s home town visiting Aunt Christine and Uncle Bob. Aunt Christine and Uncle Bob had moved to a new place and it was a big, huge place in northern New York, kind of an old rural area. And they had this big living room that they were going to have a Christmas party in. It was like half the size of the Coliseum. It was like the banquet hall at the Windham Hotel where we had our Spanish conference banquet and dance in. There were three Christmas trees at this width-wise end, and I asked Mom to show me how to turn them on, turn the lights on, and she said they weren’t even decorated yet. And people were starting to come and we took Aunt Christine and Uncle Bob and Granny was still alive at the time, and we went outside to see the waterfall on the river that ran by their house, and we saw a waterfall that she called Luria Fall. And then I woke up."
218,"Dreamed I wasn’t getting my work done it looked clean, but I had only feed kids once—they were OK with it but I knew I wasn’t able to do it the way I should. I’m not doing what I should."
219," I’ve just been dreaming like crazy last night. First I dreamt that there was a Rolling Stones concert on TV and that Dad kept flipping channels and we weren’t able to see it. Then, we finally settled down, and we could see it. And he wanted me to be careful of turning up the volume on the amplifier because one of our speakers was out already. And then I was on the porch and ___?___ had shipped us this big piece of furniture by accident. And so we had it setting around and we didn’t know what to do with it. And then we were at a park. Then I was writing a current event, and I was writing something about the echoes of the amplifiers ringing in my head. And I just remembered she’d heard that already. I don’t know what she’s going to think when she hears it again. And then I was at the park. We were having a picnic, a picnic with Sheryl, Sandra and Sam, and Steve, and Chris and Michelle were there too. And we were all sitting around, and I was sitting far away at first, but then I heard where they all were and I came with the left-over bowl and joined them. And I thought that they were singing the high school alma mater, but that was some other group of people. And the thing that Sound & Vision shipped to us by accident was sitting behind our table and was like, it was like what do we do with it, and not related to the fact that that’s not where it came from. And then I woke up."
220,"Phil had moved back in, again, he was uninvited back in the house doing trivial things and things I didn’t like… making small almost unseeable designs on pages, spending all his energy on the inconsequential and ignoring me..us…, pretending to be a foreign professor and raking students over the coals thinking it was a lark, and yet I felt he was there to stay and maybe I had to surrender for my kid’s sake and then I would be old and too vulnerable to make him leave..I would have to endure his insertion into my life. a loss of freedom and independence."
221," I had a dream. I dreamt that we were in the back yard and that Lucy and Robert were planning to buy a house, and we had several rows of chairs set up in the back yard. And Lucy and Robert were looking in the window of our house, and they were going to tell the people in the back row, who were going to tell the people in the next row, who were going to tell the people in the next row until it got all the way to the front row, about the comments about our house. And it was supposed to be like a communication system without them having to yell. That was weird. And then I dreamt that we were in this hotel and this guy was kind of like overstaying his welcome. He didn’t check out or something. And he wasn’t supposed to be in that certain room. So they took him and they were going to take him to another room, and the other room was like a dark cellar thing like an elevator shaft, and they just threw him down the elevator shaft, and he went, “Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh…..” And then I woke up. "
222," I had another dream last night. I dreamt that we were at the park with the boom box and Mom, we were playing with Celine Dion’s CD and we took it out for some reason and Mom stepped on it and cracked it. And she said, “She was beautiful, but now she’s cracked.” And the case and the CD were both cracked. And then we were running around the lake and we were playing a tape in this tape player that I’m using right now, and it’s just this little thing about twice the size of the palm of my hand and it has a little strap on the side of it. But in my dream it had a much longer strap that would go over my shoulder, and I had it over my shoulder and I was running with it. And it was playing something; I don’t remember what. And then I kind of woke up."
223,"At one point I am at my mom's house, sleeping over. I woke up the next day and some friends and I were going to go to some amusement park or something, then suddenly everyone backs out at the last minute. This one male friend of mine says he had  free passes and would take me if I still wanted to go, so I said sure. We are driving there and he makes a comment about my car that it's running funny, next thing you know we are crashing. This part gets wild. The car is going all over and suddenly I am no longer in the car I am watching it unfold from above. I above what looks like the Manhattan skyline and our car is now a firetruck that has crashed onto the top of a building similar to the empire state building, how did it get up there, good question. Suddenly I am back in the ""truck"", it's hanging off the edge of the building. I look around for my purse and don't see it, the guy I was with told me to just get out and he would get my purse. I get out, then from inside the truck he throws me my purse. Then suddenly the truck falls and he falls with it, it gets caught and is just barely hanging there, he is hanging outside the truck holding on to some bar. There are people around and the police come in, I frantically tell them to do something, while they take their time assessing the situation. Suddenly the dream goes in some totally different direction. Now I am at some house there are all these girls there who are waiting to go on blind dates, all the girls I see in the room  were black females, one was very heavy set. Then I run into this one girl, white chick with black hair, and the whites of her eyes were light blue. She was talking to me about something, while sucking on a lollipop, but I don't remember the conversation. Then I woke up."
224," I had a dream about the amplifier. I dreamt that we were, first of all, I dreamt that we were going into this movie theater, but then before the movie started, we were at home and we were watching the movie with the amplifier on. And we were going to take an intermission for a while, and I put it on tuner and, it started doing this thing where it went louder and louder all by itself. And so I took it and I held the knob and I kind of clicked it back into place, and then it was okay for a while. Then it started going down, down, down, down instead of up, up, up, and so then I had to kind of click it into place again, which is really not the way to do it in real life. "
225,"Ok I only remember a small part of this dream. I was adopting  more kittens. In the dream I already had my  current cats. I was at this persons house and got to pick out  kittens. I picked  cute ones and put them in this little soft pet carrying bag. They barely fit in there, or so it seemed. Yeah that's all I remember... :)"
226,"There was a lot more to this dream but I only remember the end. I was working on a computer or something and suddenly it wasn't working right. A message popped up saying that they were having problems because of power outages in Virginia. I looked outside and the sky was extremely dark and gray and it was very windy! I was concerned that maybe a tornado was coming. I was looking out all the windows in my condo to see if I could see anything coming my way, then I woke up."
227,"Torturers! I am in a public building I think a hospital and I am shivering in terror. I am terrified, but I don’t know why. I position myself on a couch lying down with my back against the wall for safety—People—a male and Janet promise they will not leave me alone, but they do. I notice people passing in the hall. I see the same blonde or wht. haired man pass by twice both times looking in my direction. He looks sullen and is in a wht. drs. Coat. The next scene I am being held down by a man that says he’s going to cut my fingers off. First however we must dig a line around the fireplace in the brick  He is using something like a lineoleum or wood cutter. I help because I think at least it will dull the blade but I can’t imagine what its for—perhaps to drain the blood off the altar. In comes another man and gets my other arm and says he is going to cut those fingers off—he also has a small tool kinde like a pizza wheel or dress marker. I am fighting and screaming but I don’t seem to make much noise! Oh my God! "
228,"Oriental Land Owners. I had a strange dream also that was in the orient. Somehow I helped a young couple that was very much in love by allowing him to stay nearby and work. Now he has saved up enough money and is planning their wedding. They thank me tearfully . Another young man says he must go to war next week—WAR! Yes, he must travel a distance to get people to pay their homage or taxes. Next scene I am watching as they  put a smoke or tear gas bomb in a house of sleeping people. When they come out they are a crew of poor people of all ages and none of the tribe that should pay! The soldiers were very disappointed! "
229,"I remember very little of this dream, remembered it later during the day. But my brother appeared in my dream  and in the dream I hadn't seen him in a very long time. It was the ""present"" so he was older. I felt extremely happy to be talking to him and was telling him that we had to start hanging out more and he agreed. I also remember asking him about his best friend Cory. That's all I remember."
230,"In Denial? I am playing tennis with Meg but to me horror I discover that my arms don’t work like they used to. The left throws the ball up but it goes everywhere; worse though my right arm hitches ½ way thru the service swing and won’t go above my head. I used to have a good serve, but my arms are not receiving the messages from my brain doing what I tell them! Moreover I can’t see when I move out on the court to play w/ Amelia who just arrived! All I can see is dog shit on the court, but if I look up I can’t see. So I busily clean up the shit to cover that I can’t see. I try to walk off the court along a walkway and bump into a box of photos  prints  w/ my arm. I still can’t see. A tennis pro walks past me and asks how my arm is. I am confused; what does he mean? "
231,"Ok I remember just a bit of this dream. There was some contest where we had to collect a certain amount of stones, I think, and get them back to the finish line before everyone else. I remember we all ran into what looked like a bedroom. There were all these colorful rocks on the floor, the really smooth, polished kinda stones. We were collecting them and then I remember seeing a bill  over in the corner, I went to look and it was $, I looked around didn't see anyone looking for it so I pocketed it. Went back to getting stones, then one team was already on their way back down. So we grab what we have and head out. I realize there are  ways to get down to the finish line. I look out this window and see this rope hanging down, basically if you go up one flight, from where I was, you could slide down the rope. I chose not to go that way. Got to the finish line and lined up what we had and we were missing something so we didn't win, that's all I remember. My partner in this race was my best friend from grade school, Tammy."
232," I had a dumb dream last night. I dreamt that I kept missing school for one reason or another, even that I was going to meet some people somewhere. We were going on this like underground bus system, and the bus driver couldn’t really see the signs as to where to go, and we were afraid she might fall off the thing, fall off the path and go down into this oblivion. And we got off and Mom called her to make sure she got to the place where she was going, and we were at lunch and then I realized it was : and there was no point in going back. Then I dreamt that I had Chemistry first period. "
233," I am with the platoon on patrol in Antarctica. Those with foot problems are asked to go on sick call. Nearly all are lame, but march to the aid station in the cold, hard snow. They overwhelm the staff who make complaints against them. I am sad because no one cares, no one understands how we suffer. A kind, middle-aged black medic tells me that Timmy Day, whose bad feet should have kept him out of the Army, will go home. But when I speak to Timmy Day, he says he has been denied sick call. He has seen no one."
234," I was dreaming up a storm last night. First of all I had a dream that I was at the pool and I was kind of swimming with some people. And then I went up on the deck and was ready to dry off. And Mom was trying to convince me to listen to a personal player, but I was too chicken. Then I convinced Mom to go in the car and get our lunch and we sat in the car and listened to the radio and ate our lunch. And then I dreamt that we were staying at this hotel, Mom and me, and I think Mom and me and Dad was supposed to come later with Sandra and Uncle Jack. And Mom and I had this room. I’m trying to think. Oh, we went out to dinner at the little restaurant that they had there, and I can’t remember, this was something scary in the room. I don’t remember exactly, but I dreamt that when Dad and Sandra got there, I gave Sandra this purple rose which was called a la la loo flower and I wanted to sing “La La Loo” on a CD along with a harp playing it, which we really don’t have a rendition with no words, but I dreamt that we did."
235,"Ok I just remember bits of this dream. I was at my mom's house and we were arguring FEROCIOUSLY about something. I mean actually screaming at eachother, I remember I even told her to Fuck off. Then someone knocked at the door, right as I told her to Fuck off. I opened the door and there were these  guys. They were coming to ""borrow"" or so I thought so astronomy books I had. But it turns out my mom had said they could have them. I was like ""WHAT?"" Then I went on to explain that they could not have my books. My mom asked why I needed to keep them so I went through each book explaining why I wasn't going to give it away. Wierd... Then I remember a part where Mohammed Ali was in my dream. We were out in my moms backyard. I can't remember what we were doing, he was younger in my dream as well. It started raining and he let me stand under his umbrella to keep from getting wet."
236,"Ok i only remember  scenes from this dream. Scene  I am with some girl and we are walking down this dark street towards this marina. For some reason we are very uneasy, I think there had been a recent rash of murders or something in the area, so we were steady looking over our shoulders to see if anyone was around. I remember as we got closer to the marina the sun was just beginning to rise so we felt better. Scene  I am in a car with my mom, we pull up to her driveway and are about to pull in when this van pulls up next to us. He is going in the opposite direction as we are. I look out the window and this guy is sitting in the driver's seat and does not look too nice. I told my mom to HIT THE GAS and she did we start moving forwards, he hits the gas and starts riding along side of us going backwards. In front of us is a parked car so right before we get to it I tell her to slam on her brakes and immediately go in reverse and hopefully he would go flying past and it would give us a chance to turn around. She does that, he goes flying past, and then I woke up. :)"
237," I dreamt that Dad and I were taking a walk through the city, and we were like, it was like almost like Disney World. There were like these rides set up and these little booths, but somehow I had the notion that it was just the city the way it was. And we were crossing busy streets and going through alleys, and I was carrying Mom’s little flat recorder, the black one that’s flat. And I had the shoulder strap over my shoulder. It was kind of under my arm, the way I carried it. And I was playing the Wee Sing tape as we were walking, and for some reason or another I didn’t want Dad to hear “Blue Bird” when we came to it, and I kept hoping that somehow this tape would stop or something. And I don’t remember exactly what the final – oh, I remember. We had finished our walk before “Blue Bird” was supposed to come on, and we got back to the house and I shut off the tape, and we went on with our day, and then I woke up. That was kind of a strange dream, wouldn’t you say? "
238,"Ok this dream was ALL OVER THE PLACE, I didn't even remember it all. At one point I am at my mom's house. My friend Chyrise and I are supposed to go out. She is supposed to call me but doesn't. I look for her number, and as usual, I can not remember it or find it anywhere, typical dream. I think I was house sitting for my mom by the way. A few times while in my mom's house I had to use the bathroom. Then I find this small round container and pick it up. It looks similar to those small round things that you can put incense in and burn it, and then you hang it up while it burns. Anyway I shake it and hear that something is inside. I open it up and it's a small bag of weed. SCORE! So I stash it in my pocket. Chyrise never does come so I run into my friend Chris  and asked him if he wanted to go out somewhere. He said sure. We go to some restaurant and I have to go to the bathroom really bad. I get to the girls bathroom, and what do you know, there is a LONG ASS LINE. TYPICAL! I wait and then decide I can't wait anymore. I exit the restaurant and they had this little security check you had to go through to get out . This young  black kid was the one doing the checks. Nothing unusual happened I just walked through. Then I am walking down the street back to my mom's house. This part get's frustrating. I have to use the bathroom so bad I decide to run. As I am running I am HARDLY moving forward at all. Kinda like that scene in Poltergiest where the hallway just keeps getting longer no matter how fast she runs. As I turn the corner I run into Kevin Spacey. He starts arguing with me that he doesn't like me. I asked him why, and he said he didn't like the fact that I was intelligent. He only liked really stupid girls. I began to argue about how STUPID that was. At that point we were infront of my/his house. It was now his house. His wife was Sigorney Weaver, she came out on the stoop and I asked her if I could use the bathroom, she said yes. Then I wake up and what do you know, I ran to the bathroom! LOL"
239,"I was in an apartment with my mom and brother. I looked out the window and there was a tornado coming.  Then dream jumped somewhere else. It was very weird we were at some park and this lady would go around and pick up germs from people who had diseases. Then they would give the germs to some volunteer to see how they would react. My friend chyrise was going to sign up to do it but then it shifted to this other guy. The gave him an injection and then he is walking down the street. he seems very out of it. I remember hearing in my dream that it caused the right side of his brain to shut down. lol He is walking across the street . These  black guys pick him up and throw him about  feet, not sure why. Then suddenly I am driving, I am in San Diego and looking for the beach or something. I am driving through this community and come up over this hill and can see the entire downtown san diego . Then I look and notice the highway and it's bumper to bumper traffic as far as the eye can see. So I continue straight and come to this weird looking bridge. It's too small for a car so suddenly my car is gone. I start walking across this bridge and then change my mind. The bridge kinda looks like a water slide. Well when I turn around to go back it appears that I had to climb back up part of the bridge which of course had water coming down it. However I don't remember climbing down that. I can't get back up so I continue forward. Suddenly the bridge is more like a stair case and I am standing over the first floor looking down from the stair case. I see a lady and holler for her. She looks up and then looks kinda mad like I wasn't supposed to be there. I come down the stairs and she and some other lady are there asking me who I was. They wanted me to come somewhere with them. I wasn't comfortable with that so I said I had to go to the bathroom. I had a feeling they worked for the same people that were injecting people with diseases. I go to the bathroom and they of course follow me in. I go into a stall and notice that next to me is someone I know. I try to warn him about what's going on and he freaks out at me for some reason. I leave the stall and these people had the guy restrained and started to walk towards me. Then I woke up. :)"
240," Last night I had an embarrassing dream. I dreamt that I was in school and that I was drawing a picture, and for some reason when I was done drawing the picture, I got up on Frank’s desk and I perched and I did something really sick. And I kept doing that and doing that and doing that for almost like fifteen minutes, and everybody around me was staring at me, but in my dream I just didn’t care. I don’t know what it was about the picture I was drawing, or anything, but oh, it was so embarrassing. I woke up relieved, but when I woke up, I didn’t remember my dream until I got to school and I sat down at my desk. Every so often I’ll have a dream like that, because the dreams tell the truth about your subconscious. "
241," I dreamt that I was living a story, and that there was this poor family that lived in a house and their mom worked ten hours a day for fifty cents an hour. And they had a Santa Claus shaped radio that they’d use to keep in contact with their mom; it was a two-way thing. And the oldest one was kind of hard to deal with ____?___ too much ____?__. And I can’t remember too much, but also Mom and I were sitting at my desk and for some reason I had to take the knobs off the amplifier. First I took the volume knob off while it was pretty loud, then I couldn’t turn it down, so I said, “Give it back to me, put it on and turn it down.” And then I took it off and gave it back to her. And I took the selection off too. I don’t know why, I guess we needed to trace them for something. Then we were talking about what to get those kids a new toy for Christmas. And then I woke up. "
242," First I had a dream that for some reason Mom was, I was trying to show Mom the difference between non-compressed audio and , and she had a CD with ’s on it, and somehow some way it played in my CD player. And it sounded like a tape, it sounded like a cassette tape, and I was trying to tell her that, and I couldn’t seem to figure out how to explain to her the density of each stream of audio difference of the quality. "
243," And then I dreamt that we were practicing on the steps of a fountain-like thing, and it was after school, and we were just having all kinds of bad luck. Mrs. Dougherty thought that if she got, she went home and she got her other shirt, then maybe we would behave better, and so she took her shirt off and she was in her slacks and her bra, and she goes home, then comes back with a baby shirt. And then her CD player won’t work, and for some reason she had it connected to a TV. I didn’t really understand that. "
244," I had a dream last night; actually, I had several choppy ones. I dreamt that I was in Ms. Hanson’s class, and she was having us copy things. She had this bag that stunk and she just wanted us to copy what was due on Monday and make sure we understood everything. Then I was watching a variety show, and they had Jackson Brown perform the stay  song. And then we were having this Christmas party, and Mary Lou was there, and Ms. Alexander and Peter were all there. And it was Allison’s birthday, I think, and Allison didn’t come yet. And then we put on this CD of instrumental stuff, and Ms. Alexander and I were singing. And I was telling Ms. Alexander, I mean, Ms. Alexander was telling me that my grade was gift  of my voice, and I told her that Mrs. Dougherty really brings it out in me and she should volunteer for us sometime. And then she said that she had to go, but then she came back with this big jar that was like a candle thing, and she gave it to Allison for her birthday. And then she was helping us lift things into this truck for some reason. And then I woke up."
245," I dreamt that I was getting radiation done for some reason, and I was so afraid that it wasn’t going to enough, I mean, that it was going to be too much. And the radiation would come from a laser beam from the CD player, and the CD would spin around, and when the CD would be a certain point, they would complete the circuit and the radiation would happen. And next thing I knew I was going to a party at headquarters with Terri. Mrs. Dougherty was at the reception desk. In the back of the, when you get into the party it was like a store, and I was looking at all these different things – stuffed animals and tree-top angels and things, things and then I started thinking about Brittany’s reindeer and I woke up."
246," Last night I had a stupid dream that I was at Uncle Carl and Aunt Joyce’s house and I was feeding chickens back there, in their back yard, and I was sitting out there looking at the flowers and things. And I was singing this song to the tune of “Blue Bird,” something like, “Blue bird, chicken corn in your flowers,” something really stupid like that. I can’t remember, but I think, oh, Dad told me in my dream, “If you were a flower sitting on the fence, and there was this gas in the fence that was affecting you, you would try to burn the fence up.” I don’t remember exactly how it went, but it was something about covering your tracks. I should have said it when I first woke up, because then it was fresh in my memory. "

248," I had a couple of dreams last night. First of all I dreamt that I was in Spanish class, and there were only four other people there. And I remember telling Ms. Hammond that I have a mandatory chorus rehearsal to go to, and she let me out, “no problemo.” Then I went and I came into the auditorium and I sat down with four other people who were kind of in the auditorium; we were up in the balcony. And Mrs. Dougherty was kind of pacing around and talking to us, like she does, and kind of instructing the other people as to how they were supposed to stand and all when we went on stage, and then all of a sudden, in poured the class and they were noisier than anything. And they were just real loud and ruckussy in their sound filled the auditorium, and trying to get everybody quieted down, I don’t remember exactly how. But we were supposed to be taking pictures for the yearbook, I guess, and everybody had to be in long pants and some kind of a shirt, which really didn’t make a whole lot of sense, but that’s how it was in my dream. And then Mrs. Dougherty was explaining how some of the boys were so fat that they couldn’t even sit down in their chairs. And then I woke up and it was like :. Then I went back to sleep and I had another dream. I dreamt, first of all, that I was in my bedroom and that it was daylight. And I had this bathtub full of Christmas decorations, which that’s the place I was storing my presents for Christmas. But I was taking the bears out and putting them around, and this one bear I hung on the door, and it was this snoring musical bear where it had a three-way switch to just snore or just snore and play music too. And the other thing was this reindeer. It was just like the mechanical one that I used to have, only the mechanical one doesn’t run any more. But in my dream the mechanical part didn’t run, but for some reason it was playing . and it was sound, and that just made me go bananas in my dream. I closed my door, I closed both of my doors so they latched in my dream, and  I kind of perched on the bed and then it was the bathtub that I perched on. It was so wild that I was kicking my legs around and stuff, and I was holding onto the railing.  Oh, that was another one of those embarrassing dreams. I hope nobody ever listens to this tape. And then when that wild episode was over, I came back into the bedroom from being in the bathtub, I came back into the bedroom, and there I found Mom on my bed snoring away, and I wondered how she got in there and what she saw. And then I woke up."
249,I dreamed Phil was back in my life  and I can’t see or didn’t see.
250," Last night I had a dream that Dad took me to the radio station where I’m going to intern and just kind of set me loose to explore around. And I came to this big foyer area that had a white floor and a big huge Christmas tree, and there were carolers sitting and this elderly woman who was directing them, kind of like Barbara. And I went over to her and I talked to her, and she was this really high soprano that could hit this high B-flat, and she couldn’t understand why I couldn’t. And so I told her that, I told her to tell Mom and Dad to meet at the big Christmas tree at : o’clock. And then she kind of led us on this tour thing, and we went into this other foyer that had carpeting and there were like boxes and stuff all piled all over everywhere. And she watched me go into this other little room where I had to climb over boxes to get to her, and there was like a broadcast booth and I sat there in the back. And it turned out that this is Elizabeth’s car and it’s not a transmitter, but a receiver in there. And Elizabeth’s car drives away and drives back home. And Dad says, “She was sitting over there till we got there.” Then I had this subordinate dream that my watch said : in the morning when I was supposed to have been out the door at :, and Bobby’s clock said : in the morning, and I couldn’t read the time on mine. And I went clear to the microwave and the microwave said : in the morning. That was weird; I didn’t know exactly what time it was."
251,I awoke dreaming I was teaching in a new school. I met the large class in a large unweildly room but was told that even tho’ I had  lg. classes in the a.m. before the other art teacher even began teaching I would meet my classes in a small section of what I thought was the classroom. I did tell one sassy girl who did not want to be in the class to leave and I knew somehow I would have to reduce the no. of my students. 
252," This is the first dream of the year . I dreamt that I was at the radio station – no, first I dreamt that something funky was going on with our amplifier, and Dad was going to get another one to have on reserve in case ours doesn’t work. And we were going to Circuit City or Best Buy and pick one out and then set it up somewhere and make sure that it worked. And I’m waiting and waiting for us to go and Dad’s on the computer and watching TV and talking to Carl and doing stuff and getting computer games, and we haven’t been yet. And then I woke up from that one and I kind of drifted into another dream that we were driving around town up by Zimmerman Park and Mom was scared to carry a two-way radio to keep in touch with me. I don’t why, probably because I was, or I used to be, well, I used to be. I dreamt that I was at the radio station for my first day my title would be “teletist” – and it looks a lot like my bedroom, and I was sitting down talking to either Kira or Rose or somebody, and then I realized I was naked. And so I closed myself in my closet and I got some clothes on and then I came out and started doing some things. And they had this large buffet set up or chicken and bacon and beans and salad, and these big, gigantic cookies. And I took a bite of one of these cookies and then I woke up."
253," Last night I had two odd dreams. First I dreamt that Mom and I were going to take a boat out with Ms. Fletcher and her people, and have like a little parade through the channel. And we were at the park feeding pigeons at the pond and we got up and we went home and we went in the garage and we kind of, we had to climb up this ladder to get on the boat. And Mom started it up to make sure it had plenty of fuel, and we were just standing there watching it run, and I was kind of nervous. Then we shut it off and hitched it up to the car and driving down the street, and then before I knew it, we were in the parade. And I don’t remember too much after that."
254," I can’t believe that I had this – well, yeah, I can because my head comes up with stuff like that. I dreamt that I was by the Christmas tree and we had this angel with a music box. And she had these fiber optic lights that would change different colors and bright and dim depending on the strength of the signal. We were just cleaning garbage out from underneath the couch, and then I woke up."
255," It is dark. I am with the platoon in a foreign country. We are on an exposed slope facing the wood line. A voice mocks us. I am trying to invent a weapon that will fire small grenades more accurately than tossing them. The clumsy firing device resembles a slow-loading flintlock. Only the first grenade explodes in the wood line. Nearby Ed W. quickly chucks grenades one after the other. The platoon retreats. I become separated, lose my weapon and panic. Then we regroup and fall back. An old officer says my boonie hat is worn out. The flimsy material has lost its shape. My CMB pinned in front is missing, as are the encircling love beads, the Cav patch sewn on top, the grenade rings clipped round the brim. There is no ground-in muck, no accumulated sweat. This hat cannot be mine. We enter a large wooden house and line up in a stairwell which leads to a cellar where we will be issued new hats. A pretty American girl with long hair makes her way past. I have no desire for her. It is a good feeling to be with my men."
256," Last night I had a dream that I was in the Navy and that I was trying to install this thing on the ship, and it was this little CD player in a wicker basket that was supposed to hang from one of the doorways and people could just go and sit over there and listen to it on the sound system. And I was walking around the ship with Ms. Fletcher and some other people and all of a sudden we were out on the deck singing Christmas Arlenes. And Ms. Fletcher kind of turned into Mrs. Dougherty and she was leading us in song, and then I realized that we weren’t on a ship but we were in a building and I was singing with the group in this building. And then I went into this office and I started speaking Spanish to Rose Bouvier, who is the promotion lady at the radio station. The only thing I can think why I dream about Rose Bouvier is because I was going to intern there, but now I find out they don’t take anybody unless they’re , and I took it pretty hard. So I think I’m going to have another dream about her tonight."
257," Last night I had a dream that Elizabeth and I were riding home from school and we got out of the car and we started walking down this dirt road, and she told me that this was where her husband’s mom and dad were. And so we were walking down this dirt road, and before we knew it we were in the woods, and there were these geese all around and then there were baby geese in this little area. And then we saw somebody come up behind us and start shooting. And somebody was accusing us of doing that. And then I went inside and Mom had spilled root beer all over my bed and I was talking about how good I take care of a baby when I really don’t have one, and I probably never will."
258," Last night I had a dream that for some reason or another I was getting a keyboard, either I was getting one or Elizabeth was going to bring one over. And it had steel keys, and we were back from a walk, and I got a call from Elizabeth’s cell phone saying that she would be right over bringing the keyboard and we were going to jam. And so I went upstairs to get my sound system set up, get the mixer ready to take the keyboard and mix it with my voice. And I, for some reason the CD burner was sitting on my chair. And then I realized that there were two of them; there was one in its normal position and one that was sitting on my chair. And I was supposed to put it on top of the tape player, which is to my right when I’m sitting at my desk, and the amplifier and CD burner are to my left. And I was supposed to put the second CD burner on top of this tape player, and there was also this extra external CD player that would feed stuff into the mixer for me that I had to, and so I was stacking up all these units and then I turned the light off and I sit down and I turn on my amplifier, and the amplifier is just this massive, this massive receiver like I see in Sound Invision  and it’s got this fluorescent display that these wild colors that change color with the tone that I hear. And it had a tape deck built right into it. I was like, “Wow!” And I exploring all these different functions, and I was listening to a Kenny Rogers tape in it and it sounded pretty good. It didn’t sound as good as my other tape player though for some odd reason. And if I was listening to this tape and watching the display fluorescently change and the indicators flash, I slowly faded into consciousness and my radio came on and startled me awake. I never did get set up to jam with Elizabeth, which she really doesn’t play the keyboard. I was just dreaming that."
259," This is the next day. Last night I dreamt that I was at this farm like type thing, and what in the world is going on with this tape? And I had this dream that there were these horses and this guy stepped away and I had to hold them like dogs on a leash and keep them from running away. And they were starting to like wrestle me down and stuff, and finally the guy came back. They were starting to eat the clothes off my body, and the guy came back and got them under control. And we were taking them down to the water for some reason, and then all of a sudden, when I reached the second floor, I realized that we were at our house. And somehow I had the notion that Dad was going to bring the PU  around front in the truck, and I was going to have to climb out the window and cross this little bridge-like type thing going out in the back of the truck and ride along in the back. And then I woke up."
260," I had a dream that I remember vaguely. We were in the old brown truck that we used to have, and for some reason it was a stick shift. And Dad and Mom and I are starting out on this long road trip and we’re driving this stick shift. And I think the radio was being real difficult, so we just shut it off, and I had the notion that the ____?__, and I think a back-up one too. And I think I remember something like – oh gee, so vague – you would shift the stick shift and there was this chain that would kind of whip around a little bit. And there was this stuffed dinosaur in the truck that was like hanging around on the floor, and I think the stuffed dinosaur got in the way of the chain. I don’t remember. And then I woke up."
261," Last night I had a dream that I was going to be the sound technician at somebody’s wedding, and then I realized that it was Sandra’s wedding instead of Mark and Teresa’s wedding like we’re planning. And Sandra was in town staying with us and we were hanging aaround and it was like : in the afternoon and the wedding was supposed to be at :. And I had to get all my stuff together and hurry up and get over there, and I got over there finally in time. And Sandra took me up in the church to show me their sound board and I was kind of assessing it and everything, and Sandra is standing in front of the window that overlooks the church, you know how sound booths have, and she’s standing in front of this window to keep other people from seeing in. She’s kind of pointing things out here and there, and then up comes the pastor of the church in his loud preaching voice, up into the booth and says, “Now who is doing what up here?” And then I woke up."
262," Last night I dreamt that we were on this boat thing. It was kind of like a boat and a bus all in one. I think it was one of those duck things. And it was supposed to take us from like Fort Henderson all the way up to the top of my home state and then back down, for whatever reason, and it would go on water sometimes and it would go on land sometimes. And we would sit there like we’re sitting on a bus, and then we’d get up and walk around and see all this stuff around. And Elizabeth was there and I was led back in this kitchen area with her and Mrs. Horne was there and she slipped down and she says, “Hide behind me. I’ll get in a lot of trouble.” And so I kind of like hide behind her because she’s so big, I can hide behind her. And they sit down and start eating this breakfast, like eggs and stuff. And she gets up and I kind of get up and I stand and I look at these people sitting on the couch, and then I like go in the bathroom behind someone. And then I woke up."
263,All I remember is myself and a guy and his girlfriend were walking through the stands at this football game looking for some guy. Don't remember anything else.
264,"I only remember a portion of this dream. First I am in my mom's house , in my bedroom and we are all going somewhere and I am looking for some white shorts. Now usually my dreams are pretty vivid and clear however if I ever start to look for something things become quite blurry and it's hard to see. I was looking through this pile of clothes and I could hardly see them. I thought it was wierd but of course it didn't alert me that I was dreaming. I kept thinking to myself that if I saw a peice of white clothing, even though I couldn't see them that well if it was white it was a good chance it was my shorts, but I couldn't find them. Then there is another scene where I am in the hallway in the upstairs part of our house. I come up the stairs and see this big pile of shit on the floor of the hallway. There is this cat there who obviously laid the shit *grin*. A friend of mine was in the bathroom, and my mom was up there too, and my mom said ""That cat shit on my carpet"" and she went to grab the cat. My friend was the owner of the cat and freaked otu cuz she thought my mom was going to hurt the cat or something, I told my friend not to worry about it that she wouldn't hurt the cat. Then I go into my mom's room, she is in there standing in front of her dresser. I remember tell her to pay attention or we would crash, turns out our house was now a  commercial airliner. She said ""Don't worry we are only going  miles an hours"" then suddenly I am outside of the plane watching it, now longer participating in the dream, but observing. I see the plane land on the highway and then it immediately takes off again. It was very ominous looking, it was late at night and there were no cars in sight. Very weird. That's all I remember."
265,"First dream was short I had a horse, who was like a pet, lived at home with us. I remember in the dream I was hugging the horse and brushing him etc. Then I remember it was night and time to go to bed, I was laying in my bed and my cat was there and then I looked over and the horse was sleeping in the bed too haha but it had to be a small horse because it actually fit in the bed. Then I was awakened for real at : AM because someone was knocking extremely loud next door. The next dream was weird, my brother  and my mom were in it. At one point in the dream me and my mom got in an argument that was so bad I actually walked out. I remember me and my brother were talking about getting an apartment together and being roommates. Then there was another part of the dream where there had been some kinda contest or game and we each ""won"" someone to date. It was odd but I was supposedly dating this one guy I don't remember much beyond that. Then I was in this place that was like / my job and / the house I grew up in. This chick I work with named Dorn was sitting at the receptionist desk. While I was down the hall where I couldn't see her I heard her saying something about Christians and how great they were *cough*. Then I go into this room which looks like a studio apartment, I see this kitten running around so I go in to get the kitten. The room is pretty dark and I think the TV is on. Then this guy comes out of the bathroom in a robe and starts talking to me, we have a pretty detatil conversation but I don't remember most of it."
266," This is either January  or February . I think it’s January . I don’t remember too much about my dream last night because I let myself sleep in until like : this morning, off and on. And so I was kind of dozing and having different little scenes going on. But the one that I can remember most is that we had, I was back in my home town, of course, and we had this thing going on where we had chickens, of course, I think we had three of them. We haven’t had three in a few years. And we also had this cow, this mini, mini, mini, miniature cow that was like the size of a Chihuahua dog that kind of was there to keep an eye on the chickens and stuff like that. She would run her dogs off because the chickens were just too chicken. I can’t really remember any kind of situation except I picked her up once, holding her and showing her to the kids on the porch, just like a Chihuahua person would pick up their Chihuahua dog. And then I went around to the front gate and put her in the yard and she ran over and kind of made friends with the chickens, and that’s all. And then I woke up."
267,"This was a WEIRD WEIRD DREAM. I am at some observatory where you can observe the stars but uh in real life i don't know any observatory like this. You get on this contraption that is like a ride. Try and picture this. They have this huge ring/circle that goes up about  stories in this HUGE room. The circle is hollow it's just like a big ring. They strap you to it and you start spinning around. Because it's so large it takes you a bit of time to get all the way around. So I am on this contraption and it starts to spin, somehow this helps you view the stars. Of course I don't remember viewing any stars while on it, but I did gain this vision of people who were living on mars. People from earth who had colonized there, it was interesting. Then at some point I start getting a little nauseated from all the spinning. Towards the end of the ride I could REALLY feel the force of this thing as it spun. Because of the way it was set up you were making revolutions like you would on a ferris wheel, however much faster and you were just strapped in. I was amazed, when I woke up, how REAL it felt. Finally I yelled ""Hey get me down from here"" and the lady let me off. I couldn't stand up and kept stumbling because I was dizzy, felt way too real. Then I am in my mom's house. She and my dad  come home from some movie and my dad was drunk . All I remember is being mad because my mom had promised she would see that movie with me. I think it was new years eve so I was a bit upset she would rather spend it with my asshole father then with me, in real life she wouldn't have though. That's all I remember."
268," I had a dream that I was in Spain with Mom and Dad, and somehow we got our car over there and we were riding on a bus, and we were riding back to our hotel where our car was. And I was asking the bus driver in Spanish where this mountain with these carvings on it was so that we could drive over to it. And I was constantly translating for Mom and Dad in different places. And then we were in our car and it was like we were driving through an amusement park. It was all kinds of stuff, only it was all in Spanish. And I was constantly translating. And then next thing I knew we were in this auditorium watching this show, and again it was all in Spanish because we were supposed to be in Spain. And the person next to us who was giving us these candies, this box of candy called Blue Bird Song Candies, and it was the oddest, dumbest thing. And then I thought that I had woken up, but I was still dreaming, so I was basically dreaming of waking up. And I dreamt that I was telling Mom what a scary, scary dream I had. And she said, “You have scary dreams almost every two weeks.” "
269," I’ve got a lot of updating to do on this tape. First of all, a couple nights ago I had a dream that I was coming home from a trip and on the way home we stopped at school and it had kind of renovated, and first of all the librarian had left the library, and second of all, the lobby had been renovated and everything and the bathrooms had amazing turnstiles called “yoo hoo” turnstiles because you had to say, “Yoo hoo” when you went through them. And Mom and I were talking about eating lunch in the lobby, and then we continued on home and my house had been renovated. There was a bed in the dining room with a tape player just sitting on top of it, and where the monitor is there was a shelf full of books and I was thinking, “How strange is that!” And it was an old-fashioned antique bed and I called it the dench beds. And last night I had a kind of a hodge podge dream. First I had a really kind of scary dream that I was with this girl, this other teenager, in this house and we were eating these candies, and first she gave me this one candy that was out of a pot of, you know, she just made it and she gave it to me. And it was so good. But then we went in this other room and there was a big accordion-shape candy, and just being near it made me short of breath, and I couldn’t breathe very well. And she gave me a piece and I was almost ready to pass out and I ran out of the room. And then I woke up. Gee, I don’t know. Oh, and then I had another little dream that night that Canada and Russia were going to war for some reason, and we were going to get inside of Canada. Dad was thinking about going over there and videotaping most of the whole thing. I know there was more, but I can’t think of it now."
270,"Frustrated Dismayed and Confused. Dreamed a strange dream: . In a new house. I wanted to take down iron scrolling on front door includ. old residents name but a male told me not to—everything had a reason for being there—they were connected, or worked together! . I want to buy my sons new clothes for school but they don’t want to quit playing to shop. They need new clothes as they are wearing old clothes that don’t fit them. . I’m waiting on a Sears delivery truck to bring something for the new house. I see one and flag it down saying this is the house he’s looking for—but it isn’t. I watch in dismay as it drives off. . My daughter-in-law gets dressed up in a ball gown and tells my son she will be gone for a month and starts walking.  I remember walking into the house where she is going. There is a very old woman in a bed in a corner of the room, but on the walls are pictures of everyone in my family. Who is this lost relative? Someone tells her I am here, but I don’t know her. . My oldest sons—grown now——tell me his mother has gone around the house  and collected all the cash and put it w/ some of hers supposedly and distributed it in  equal amounts to them. I am furious that she dare touch $ not hers They didn’t really know how much they had and now their finances are all a mess—confused! "
271," I had a dream last night. Mom and I were at the store, Service Merchandise, I think it must’ve been, and she was buying kitchen supplies. And then we were in the Electronics Department, and we saw this big, we saw all kinds of speakers and stuff like you see in Circuit City. We also saw this box, this big Grand Year box that had a picture of Celine Dion, and it was a keyboard, a Celine Dion keyboard, and it was supposed to be a replica of one that she played. And Mom got it for me, and I was thinking to myself, surprising Mom by learning to play, but I was thinking how this Celine Dion keyboard was brown and it angled kind of slightly up like the mixer. And it was really strange because it had this stand-alone amplifier with an internal speaker, and I used a like speaker wire to connect it. I was sitting on the stairs with this keyboard on my lap and I connected it to this amplifier with speaker wire and I was going to play, and I was going to surprise people. And things kept happening and I never got to. I think they were going to the beach and walking along the beach and I was telling people that I was going to do it. Then I woke up. I never did get to do it. "
272,Mother has a Retarded Child. I have to take care of them.
273," Last night I had a dream that I was on a cruise ship and I remember we were with some of the fire people and we were eating chicken fingers and stuff from the buffet. And we were kind of dancing at this little dance bar buffet restaurant on the cruise ship, and then we decided that we weren’t going to, we decided we were going to get in little dinghies and go row alongside of the ship. And so I was in my little dinghy and I kept tipping it over like a canoe, and by the time I knew it, I was floating on top of it. And then all of a sudden we were at home, and Mom and I were blasting the sound system waiting for Dad and the fire people to come over and join the party. And some lady – I think it was the HRS lady from Elizabeth’s case – came in and wanted some tea, some herbal tea from Mom. And she was real rude. And we ended up shutting off everything before the people got to the party. And then I woke up."
274,I am taking care of women w/ dementia they are exhausting me.
275," Last night I had a dream that me and Crystal were trying to make something and I had these three-dimensional cookie dough kids, these little statues and a three-dimensional heart statue. And I was trying to stand them up on the cookie sheet and make the kids hold the heart, but they kept falling down and rolling around, and I don’t know how I was going to bake them. But Mom was going to bring Terri and Mrs. Dougherty over for tea or something. I knew I had to hurry up and get them in the oven so they’d have time to bake, but I couldn’t get the darned things to stand up. But once I did get them in the oven, Crystal, something happened and Crystal pushed two very delicate plates off the shelf and they broke all over the floor and everything, so then I had a mess to clean up. I don’t remember too much more. Then I woke up."
276," Last night I had a dream that we were at some theme park like Disney World or Tyme Gardens, but I couldn’t figure out which. And for some reason we were with Carl and Arlene. And Dad was showing me this ride that was like a race car and he said that if it was going to go on a roller coaster, it had to have three seat belts for the same passenger, one that goes on top of another. And they had to wrap around the front seat and go in the back seat so that they could be for two passengers. And all of this looked really scary, and I noticed that this car had something in it that most race cars don’t have, which is in the audio system. And then we were looking around at some other different rides and seeing how wild they were, and we figured, “Hey, let’s go on this conveyor belt through this place.” And it was like a building with a couple of different things in it. And we went, we jumped on the conveyor belt and we saw this monster just running across it. I started running too and I couldn’t figure out why we were running. And then we were at this show watching the Little Mermaid swim around this fish aquarium tank. It was supposed to be like she was singing a song, but we all know she wasn’t singing in the water."
277," Yesterday, last night, I had a dream that Dad and I were at the Green Point having a picnic and Dad was over doing his exercises and I had the boom box on my blanket. And I was playing the “Wee Sing” tape. And it was playing and going on and going on like the stuff that it has and then a couple songs before “Blue Bird” I decided it wouldn’t be such a good idea for us to hear that, so I shut off the tape and put on the radio. And soon after Flounder from the Little Mermaid was coming up to our blanket like a pigeon and he had claws like a bird and he perched on my hand for a little bit. And then he jumped back into the water and I jumped in with him and I swam around for a little bit. And then getting out was like no challenge at all. The water was like a few feet down from the sea wall and after that we were going to meet Mom at this far thing like Disney World and there was this playground that we were going on and I was supposed to have a tape machine, because I was going to record all the noise and sounds and everything from the fair, but I guess I left it at the picnic area. It was really Mom’s boom box and we were going to go see Mom on this playground. And we did and I found her sitting on the bottom of this like walk-in bird cage, and we started talking about different things, and we planned to go to this like show with elephants or something. But I woke up before we got there. That was weird! But I think it has a lot of roots of my past. In this dream about me singing “Blue Bird” I wasn’t really scared; I just didn’t feel comfortable playing it in front of Dad. And the Disney World fair thing, there was a lot of, we went to Disney World a lot when I was younger and we met up with Sheryl, Sandra and Sam at different places. So that’s that."
278," Last night I had kind of an interesting dream. I dreamt that Dad and I were on this car trip and we had the Peavey system that for some reason I had the notion that the Peavey system just kind of like stayed in the car like a thing along the way in case we need it, and it was there and we took it out. We went out in this back woods campsite area and we set up and we were testing it out. And I was mostly, I was standing like about two or three feet away with the wireless microphone and talking while Dad made some adjustments and some checks and some tests at the board. And then I was going to sing something but we really didn’t have time. We had to pack up and continue on the journey home. And as we were taking down the Peavey system and putting it away, it was getting really dark and we built a campfire. And I dreamt that Dad told me he planned to bring me there for my birthday, and he said, “I’ve been checking out your equipment” and I was like, “Why?” And, “Well, I want you to have a nice evening,” which I can imagine what that would mean. And I said, “Well, I would sure like to have the Peavey system along for my birthday thing.” And, let me see, I think there was something else. Oh, then we were in the car on the way home and we were coming around the alley, we were going to pull in the back."
279," I can’t believe the bizarre dream I had last night. First of all I dreamt that Sheryl and Sandra were in town and we were going to go to dinner with Pavarotti. And we were waiting and waiting and waiting at their little apartment, and he never showed up. So we thought, “Fine, we’re just going to dinner ourselves.” Well, we never did go to dinner. We brought them home, and I was like typing up a storm because it was Sunday night and my essay was due on Monday. And I also had my vocabulary to do, and I was thinking maybe I could handwrite it, but I wouldn’t get very far. And so typing up a storm and also something happened to the computer, and it gets this weird thing going on, like it shows the keyboard on the screen like highlight the letters as you type them. And in order to get rid of this, we have to like do a whole bunch of “escape” and all this stuff, and I haven’t even saved my work to a floppy. And then I wake up with a start and I realize that the whole time I was typing I wasn’t writing my essay, I was describing and writing about the system, the system from my EJ thing that’s called the Escort . And I wake up with a start and I realize my essay is already turned in. I turned it in on Friday, and I like breathe a sigh of relief. "
280," Last night I had a bizarre dream. I dreamt that Dad gave me a pill that would make me pregnant, just as a practice run. And then I started having really bad cramps and stuff, and then I decided I really don’t want this because it’s not worth a practice run. And I was supposed to go to the doctor and get this shot to take it away, but instead they gave me a pill and it was a pill, it was like an olive and had been soaked in juice. All the olive juice went down my throat with the water and kind of made my mouth numb. But the olive wouldn’t go down. I asked her to cut it in half. She was looking around, she didn’t have a knife, so we had to take it home and cut it in half. And in the second part of the dream we were walking with Grammy to – I don’t know – just around the neighborhood, and we stopped at this church that had a fountain and everything and I wanted to explore while they walked through. Well, I went around the back and I climbed up the back steps and I perched on this little ledge and grabbed onto the window and I could see the sound board and stuff. Everybody was in there, but somehow the pastor said hello to me. He saw me over there. And there wasn’t much more to it."
281," Last night – oh, it’s windy – last night I had a strange dream. I dreamt that a security guard in the court building was showing me all kinds of devices that he had for when he was leading people into jail. And one of them was this white cup, this silver blue box with this black display in it, supposedly had a mind of its own, and it would just speak to people for no reason at all and just say things about them and stuff. And I dreamt that one of our neighbors suddenly died in her family – I think it was her father or husband or somebody – and we were going to have a condolences reception, like I had organized a little party for everybody. And it was like Mom totally took control of the whole thing, and I don’t remember exactly how it went. But I was going to bring the sound system out in the front yard and hook it up and be the DJ, and Mom was controlling the whole thing and I just said out of, not really meaning it, but to show her what I felt. I said, “I don’t have to bring my sound system out here. You guys want to control the whole thing, you go right ahead.” And that’s how it was. Then I woke up."
282," Last night I had kind of a strange dream. I dreamt that we were going to this party with the fire people, and we were driving along in the car, which for some reason our car had a siren. Anyway, we were driving along and I was supposed to call some chief on the radio and tell him we were going to be a little late, and so I did. And it started out as a professional, short transmission, but then it turned into a long-winded friendly, teasing thing. And I never did get to the party. I don’t know any more. It was kind of dumb."
283," Last night I dreamt that Arlene was visiting me. Oh no, first I dreamt that I was at this play at school, in the school auditorium, or it looked a little different. The sound booth was like under the floor of the balcony, and it was between the mezzanine and the ground, and it was like under the floor of the balcony. And the window was like out. And there was another sound booth backstage, and this girl that I know – supposedly it was Arlene – was showing me how to get to the sound booth, and the one in the floor of the mezzanine, you had this little trap door that you take off the side of the wall, and there was this little crawl space that I could barely fit through, that someone a big, fat sound technician was supposed to slither through and go up to the booth and then lay down in this little space and they’d do the mixing. And I thought I am claustrophobic and I would never make it up there. And the sound booth backstage was easy, just open a door and go in. And then I dreamt that Mom and I were in the kitchen and we were playing the “Wee Sing” tape and we were dancing to Blue Bird and we like did a slow dance to it. And then Arlene was over, and there were these roses that I wanted to give to her and I left in the bright sun and they were all wilted by the time I gave them to her. And that’s all there is to that."
284," Last night I had a dream, I mean, two nights ago I dreamt that there were these really tame mallard ducks in the back yard, stepping all over the grass and everything. And Nancy and Lorraine were here, and Dad was going to take Lorraine to court for letting Nancy step all over the grass. Last night I had a kind of bizarre but sketchy dream. I dreamt that Ms. Hanson was teaching classes in my room and that we were like dancing down the stairs or something, and then we had to go pick up Ms. Hind from this pool thing that she was at. I don’t know – there must have been more to it, but I can’t remember now."
285," Last night I had a dream that I was driving the bus, and I was at the control panel and there was like no steering wheel. There was this shifter stick thing. And there were like four or five different keys, and I’m talking quietly because I have a sore throat and I don’t want to strain it at all. There were four or five different keys, like and they made different sounds, and one made the back-up alarm sound. And I kept forgetting which ones they were and what sounds they made. And I dreamt that I swore I wasn’t going to ride the bus next year because the bus was going to get the scary back-up alarm sound, and whenever the bus would back up I was going to hear that sound. So I swore I’d never ride the bus. Then I remembered if I listened to the personal CD player on the bus that the sound would drown out the back-up alarm anyway. Gosh, wouldn’t that be scary! And then I woke up."
286,Phil has a new job to teach  science classes a day and I’ve been hired to teach  art class. I offer to perhaps take on a couple of his since he is so overloaded. I pt. out that I am a teacher and tho not a scientist I could perhaps take on  basic classes w/ a caveat to students explaining if they wanted to learn all possible they should transfer out.
287," Last night I dreamt that they were singing “Swing Low” and we were had a bunch of guests over and I showed them my music so they could learn the alto part if they wanted. I was thinking to myself that we sounded just like the strings and I heard this guy sing it, it was a solo part, except he was across the street in the hotel and I wanted to run over and see him and I did. And then I realized I was in the buff, buff naked, and so I ran past him and then I just hurried up and ran home. And then I woke up."
288," Last night I had a dream that Sheryl and Sandra and Sam were in town, they were staying at this hotel. And it was like a hotel and a school, and I had the Peavey system in a math classroom and I was going to give a talk to this business about how I set it up and how to use the stuff. And so, but I was in this math class and it was so cramped. The guy could only give me like one little desk to put my stuff on, and it was like he was going on with his lesson plans and I only got like five minutes to show them the system. Then we moved on to the next room, except we got Sheryl, Sandra and Sam and we went to the park. And we set up the system by the playground. Don’t ask me how we got power to it over there. And we took the wireless microphone and I walked over to the lake, around a ways, and I started singing a song, and people were like staring at it, like where is the person, what is going on here? And then I come back and I never did get the presentation figured out, I woke up."
289,"Transforming Grey-Haired Woman. I had a dream of a grey haired woman. She invited me to her beautiful, high ceilinged apartment. She continued to pull her loosely knit pullover sweater over her head turn it around and pull it back on for warmth! But as I watched this very chic woman with grey “Berkeley hair” pull the sweater off and over her head she changed! One moment she was chic; the next every hair was in place under a hair net! "
290," Last night I dreamt that Dad and I were on a boat, and we were like going across the diagonally off the sea wall of the beach. And then we got out of the boat. We were swimming and we were supposedly taking a shortcut to Cash and Carry. And we were swimming, and then we eventually made our way up to the beach and workers were like putting things in the sand. And there were all these electrical fan-like type things that were making noise up and down the beach. And then we were walking on the beach, and I remember being scared of all these things. And then I woke up."
291," Last night I had two dreams, the first of which I can remember quite well. I dreamt that these two boys were over, like teenagers about my age, and they were working with Dad on something. And apparently Dad got this antique fire alarm at an antique show, except it was regular wood-grain color instead of red. And it was like, it was bigger than the one we have on the porch. And they were working on it on the front porch, and I went upstairs and I thought that I still couldn’t get far enough away from it, so I went outside and I was going to swing on the little swing outside. But then they brought it out in the back yard and they started working on it out there. And I can’t remember too much more. "
292," Last night I dreamt that I was getting ready for school and for some reason I was diddling and dawdling and diddling and dawdling and I didn’t get out of the house until like :. And then next thing I know it was the weekend and Mom and I were studying math here in the bedroom, and I had shelves on both sides of my room. And she got up to go use the bathroom or go do something and I was just kind of sitting there, kind of laying there waiting for her. And this is the really strange part. I had the digital clock radio like I have, and I also had an animal clock that sat on top of some kind of machine and the talking parrot would see the bird that talks back to you also had some kind of receiver. And it was really strange. I never knew which was which. And then I woke up."
293,Woke up trying to figure out a way to bring the homeless into my house I wanted to but fear that they might steal from me. It seems to be a large building like an aprtment building and I want lots of people there. Something about logistics passing out soap. 
294,"Dream’s  image. I am looking at frame of white puc pipes w/ bed drapes similar to many I’ve taken down and given away in my homes  w/ hooks still in them. I wonder at it and then notice to the left my young son, Peter, on a top bunk perhaps w/ a bow and arrow. This was his “fort” hideout. Clever. He has been asked or told to catch a wild bird or birds. I am helping him. We have a large cage w/ a very heavy door. We propped it open with a stick w/ a rope on it so we can pull it out when a bird goes in the cage and then, slam! I put a lot seed inside and peanut butter to be very tempting to birds. I hope we are able to catch some for his sake. This is very important to him.  image. I approach an older woman—very astute spiritually or politically correct. I ruefully say to her, “I’m sure you feed the birds.” She shocks me by saying “I don’t believe in making wild animals dependent on people!” She is so far ahead of me—I never thought of that!  image. I am anxious or trying to get on the ferry “to the other side.” But to my dismay I realize the normal line to board the ferry is blocked and I will have to go through the formal dining room to get to the ferry. I can’t go thru there! I’m not dressed properly! It looks fairly empty, but I am very aware there is a woman at a table that I’ll have to walk in front of. I wake dismayed. "
295," A couple nights ago I dreamt that I was at school in this like open air stadium thing, and the sound booth was recessed like in amongst all the seats, and somehow I had a notion that I knew the technician. Arlene was with me, and we took a seat right in front of the sound booth. And it dragged on and dragged on; it was this boring thing. I couldn’t figure out if it was a race or a football game. And so anyway, sitting through this boring assembly thing, I realized that I was missing the performance for the city Performing Arts Center for chorus. And then I woke up."
296," I had kind of a jumbled dream last night. I dreamt that Mom and I were in this boat and it was kind of rocking. And I don’t remember too much about that. The next thing I knew I was in school and they were showing this movie about some girl – I can’t remember if it was Celine Dion, Pocahontas or Snow White, but it was kind of a combination of all three of those. And this guy next to me had a cell phone that was beeping, and the teacher told him to turn it off, and then it sounded making a back-up alarm sound and the teacher took it. And then I dreamt that I was in my room and I was listening to the song that was called “The Prayer” with Celine Dion and Andre Bocelli, except that Celine Dion’s voice was like all chipmunky and really, really weird. I was doing something while that was happening, while that was playing, and Dad walked in and he seemed to like the song still anyway, even though her voice was all funny and strange. And then I woke up."
297," Last night I had a dream that we were at this party, and we were dancing and eating and stuff, and they even played one or two polkas and I did the polka a couple times. And Dad went to the bathroom and Mom said, “Do you think we should stay here a little while longer?” And I said, “Yeah, it’s really fun here.” And then she looked out the window, and said, “We’d better go. There’s a big, black cloud of thunder,” and it was raining out there. So we started out, and all of a sudden we were crossing the courtyard at school and these big claps of thunder were coming closer and closer, and I was like, I fell and then I was like crawling, and I got inside the building and there were like tons of people in there. But then I realized there were puddles of water all over and I didn’t feel safer in there either. And before I knew it, Mom was having me go to the bathroom to change out of my bathing suit and Dad was supposed to be getting the bike to take us home. I never did, I never did get home. I woke up first. I had a bunch of other little dreams, but they’re so fragmented, I don’t remember them."
298,"I’m Killing Ben. I dreamed: I was in my bed but it was in the water like a boat. There are others in the bed with me—they are fishermen. They turn back my sheets and blankets—to haul up a load of fish. The fish are lying on the “bottom” of the boat/bed and I look at them resignedly. I know we have to kill them and I have a metal rod in my hand about the size of a pencil. I am taking the lead I realize, but it has to be done. so I push the rod into the base of the skull of one of the loger-head fish. But it isn’t dying—I realize w/ horror. I get a knife to cut its head off as the others are doing to their fish. As I cut around the head it becomes my beloved dog Ben, a black lab! He walks around with this deep cut around his head looking kind of like gills as it gapes open, but he seems undisturbed. What am I to do? I’ve half killed my dog? How could I have done such a horrible thing?"
299," Last night I dreamt that I was in school and I was in the Media Building, and the elevator was doing cuckoo stuff. And I lost my book. And I dreamt that this Spanish teacher gave me a set of tapes and told me to do like - or something, and I took them home and I started doing them and stuff, and then we were supposed to go ice skating with Abby and Jerry. It was like everybody was supposed to put out ice on their sidewalk so that we could ice skate from here to Disneyland. And then we realized when we were out there, we realized there wasn’t enough ice. So I went home and I was just going to dance. And I dreamt that Dad was still working, and he was going to have a few days on my vacation when he worked. And I was getting ready for this party, I think, and nothing was going right . "
300,"Ok  things stick out in this dream. What's funny is this brought back the memory of another dream that I never wrote down. It was a dream I had where I was in Australia. The dream I had last night also happened to take place in Australia, and I remember having a thought ""I had a dream that I was in australia"" and then actually remembered some of the dream . It was odd. When I woke up I did remember I actually did have that other dream because I remembered more of it. Anyway moving on.... I only remember  small portions of this dream. This first one is hard to picture but try. Imagine a HUGE corn field with stalks of corn about  feet high. Now imagine the entire field is surrounded by a wall so it completely encloses the field. Now picture water being in there all the way up to the top leaving about  foot of the corn stalk peeking out. Now take away the wall. That's what it looked like it was as if the water was holding itself up. I was walking by this water filled field of corn with someone and she was explaining to me what it was. Of course I don't remember what she said. There was one man out in the field swimming around probably checking the corn. Then I remember being in this small boat with a friend. A very small boat! I look over to the right and see this huge city, which I assumed was Sydney Australia. I am wondering how the hell we will ever get to shore. Then we see this little floating island/amusment park thing. We paddle over to it and there are these  guys there. I grab the edge to pull us closer and the guys pretend that I am pulling too hard and that it's tipping the island over and they jump into the water. LOL But they were just joking around. That's it."
301," Last night I dreamt that I was supposed to go somewhere with some friends, I think on a trip or something, and I was supposed to ride this bus, like a Greyhound bus. And it was supposed to come, it was either early in the morning or late at night, but it was dark outside. And I remember coming out with my bag and then afraid to get on it, so it just left me. And it went around the block and came back, and it backed up with the back-up alarm sound. And the driver yelled at me over the intercom to get on it, and so I did. And I was looking around for a place to sit – it was a really big bus – and I picked a seat kind of in the middle. And I put my bags down; it was my usual school bag, bag. And every time the bus had to turn, it had to use that back-up alarm sound, that two-tone back-up alarm sound. And there were two buses that were going on this trip. The one was the bus that I was riding and the other was another bus with a group. And this driver of this bus was so careless, when the bus needed to turn and had to use that back-up alarm, and it would turn in front of the other one and it would run it so close, it like scraped the front of the other one a few times. And I remember it was so close to an accident a couple times, and it was dark out. And next thing I know, I’m awake."
302,"Ok I had a continuation of the dream from the night before. That so rarely happens to me. I rarely even have recurring dreams... Similar themes sometimes but not usually the same type of dream. In this one I am once again in australia and we are once again in the water right off the shore from what looks to be Sydney Australia. It's me and a friend I used to know back in the day named Linda. We were on this floaty type thing zippin through the water. I was hanging off it so most of my body was actually in the water. I could feel things touching my legs as we zipped around, I assumed it was seaweed. Then I am in the car with my aunt and we are driving around. I told her to check out the skyline . She looks over to the left where the airport is but there is a lot of fog. I tell her to just wait a sec, and the fog lifts and we could see the city it was really cool looking. That's all I remember."
303," Last night I dreamt that I was at school and there must be some kind of an awards ceremony in the auditorium  period, and I was in chorus , and I told Mom to just meet me at a certain spot. And so I came down and I went past her and then I sat down in a seat, and then I remembered I left my notebook in chorus class. But instead of an awards ceremony, it was a movie, and the movie already started. And the seats were like way slanted, and so I had to really climb to get to the top and this alarm thing kept going off because I was blocking the projector thing. It wouldn’t go off if I stood up in the aisle, but it went off when I was climbing over the seats that were on a deep incline. And then I sat in the back and it was too soft and I couldn’t see a thing. And then this volunteer lady jumped up and helped me get down the stairs and get to the bathroom and get my notebook. And then I woke up."
304,"I remember one piece of this dream. I am at my mom's house and look up at the wall. Something is on the wall but I can't tell what. It looks like  BIG ASS bugs, and we all know I HATE bugs. Anyway as I get closer I see it's actually  small turtles. You know those little kinds that live in the water, people buy them and put them in fish tanks. Well they are crawling on the wall and I didn't even stop to wonder how these turtles were able to over come gravity and stick to a wall. I picked up the turtles and put them in a plastic bag. Then I filled a container with water and put them in there, as if I was going to keep them as pets. But I didn't feel right about that either so I took them outside and let them go. That's all I remember. "
305,"I Painted My Room . I’m in my bedroom at my parents home and I’ve decided to paint it. I go to Sarah R. for advise and she shows me some very ordinary dusty blue fabric with a small white or off white pattern but she says she can’t come help me yet; it will have to be later. I plan to wait on her but the next thing I know I am painting the walls of my room—all in one brush stroke I paint the walls in a bright and beautiful rainbow pattern! There is a space between  closet doors on one wall where I had planned to hang Sarah’s fabric but I know now, it won’t work. So I paint my own canvas to hang there in oranges and blues. Wow! Then I get some white clouds—I think I painted them on wood shaped like clouds—and hang them on the opposite long wall that is painted. When Sarah arrives she is amazed and says its beautiful and like no other. "
306,"Denial of Danger. I am in bed with my wife and I know the mafia is coming to execute me—us. I tell her tonight we have to sleep under the bed. I arrange the pillows and blankets to look like we’re in the bed and we get under the bed. We get under from her side which is closest to the wall. On my side there are boxes so they shouldn’t see us. As we lay there I remind her she must be quiet no matter what. I expect they will spray the bed w/ machine-gun bullets. She is terrified and I wonder why in the world we didn’t just escape and hide somewhere. Why did I think it was so important to carry on or pretend there was no danger?  Same dream I think. My sister tells me to be quiet Lou Ann is about the house. I am confused we are in my dead grandmother’s house why should Lou Ann care? The door opens and in walks a sensitive dark haired woman. She looks pained or wounded as she sees my sister and I in bed. She starts attacking us for being so insensitive to her needs/feelings. I think she is nuts and I tell her she is just being way too sensitive after all she is our grandmother too  She amazed me by collapsing and agreeing w/ me—she was being too sensitive! Then we are getting together photos of our families  for the grandmother. We are going to a lot of trouble and even walk to the shopping center on a low bridge that I know about w/ less traffic to get the photos enhanced and enlarged. For some reason it hasn’t dawned on any of us how much effort and money we are spending for photos for a dead woman, but suddenly it does to me. I run to catch up w/ my sister Betty and her daughters before they get started on the photos and waste their money. I tell them I’m not doing all that for a dead woman; I’m just putting my photos in the coffin as they are—I might even take out any I don’t have copies of its really just a symbolic gesture now anyway! They seem shocked!"
307," Last night I had a dream about the librarian in Mass Media. I dreamt that we were going in the room to take a test and I was holding Elizabeth’s arm like I do Mom’s and before I knew it, I was holding her hand. The librarian was saying, “How are you going to help her with this test? How are you going to be able to give it to her?” And she said, “Well, I will sit at the desk that was next to the mixer.” And in that room the mixer and all the sound stuff is out in the main room, and it was all one big room. And I remember fiddling around in there a little bit, examining the mixer, making sure it was off, and coming out and hearing the fire alarm go off and we went running. And then I woke up. "
308," I had a bizarre dream last night. I dreamt that I had gotten a Celine Dion CD for my birthday, I guess, and I couldn’t wait to play it. I couldn’t wait to see what it was. And there was another CD that had her picture on it, but was like a compilation of CD’s. And there was this teen magazine that went with it, and it had her picture on the cover, but it had all this little trivia about these different stars and stuff, and it was so cool. And I dreamt that I was looking through it and reading it on the monitor, and then I came across this Celine Dion CD and I figured I’d go and play it and see what it’s like. And then Terri rings the doorbell and she comes in, and next thing I know we’re dancing to Jimmy Buffet. And then next thing I know, I woke up."
309,"Ok for those who know, there was a rap group that came out way back called Arrested Development. The lead singer/rappers name is/was Speech . Anyway went to college with him, and we still talk on occassion. He appeared in my dream last night. All I remember is going to his house in Stone Mountain Georgia. We walked down to the basement and it was this HUGE room  with a pea green floor and windows all around. I assumed he was going to build his studio down there. We talked for a bit but I don't remember about what. "
310,Phil Steals Everything from Me and Humiliates Me. Phil loads everything I own on a moving van by deceiving me we are moving. When we arrive I walk to my parents’ backyard where we are to live. There is dirty carpet  laid out in the yard. We are to arrange the furniture on th ecarpet . I go inside to ask Phil if we can rent a steam vac to clean the carpet before we unload the furniture. He says I’ve already unloaded; I look and he has the furniture stacked in the corners of of the room—I think their bed room—in particular I notice  china cabinets one in front of another. I guess he plans for us to divide the furniture—but it’s mine he’s stealing everything I have! I tell him he can’t do that but he already has! He pulls out a broucher from my school and tells me he’s teaching everybody what he knows about me! You don’t know me! I scream. He answers I know everything about you I know every rotten thing about you and I’m going to teach them. I look at the broucher and their is a course called Nan! Later I see him walking in front of my school surrounded by a group of adoring women. I guess he told them all and they “are supporting him” and think he is so wonderful! 
311,Cloe mentioned a dream I had told her of God asking me why I always took the easy way? I apparently wouldn’t go God’s way as I insisted I would have to go up Marin Avenue! 
312,"OK I only remember bits and pieces of this one. I remember my mom, brother  and I flying to some island, we flew the plane ourselves. I don't remember specifics but I do remember my brother left and then came back and I watched him land the plane. When he got off he seemed really pissed off about something. He walked right past me as if he didn't see me. This upset me because if something was wrong I wanted to be able to help out. Then I got extremely worried that something bad was going to happen to him. I did NOT want to lose him again. I went to my mom and we were talking and then suddenly I just started to cry, I mean really cry , she just hugged me and finally I stopped. It was very emotional and felt very real. That's all I remember. I love having dreams about my brother though because it's like seeing him again. :)"
313,"Also, several days ago woke up dreaming of a man who pulls on his face like its rubber, etc., to change it back and forth."
314," I had a bizarre dream last night. First of all, I dreamt that Mom’s boom box could take the words out of songs for me, and send them over to the CD burner and burn an instrumental copy. Then I dreamt that we were reading this book about this crazy girl who wanted to, who made us want to climb diagonally up the side of a church, and see, the thing of it was you were supposed to climb diagonally up the side of the church to get to this really pretty picture, but little did we know, in like a little chariot-like type thing on the roof of the church on either side there was a bad girl who did like bad things. And we were walking through this museum about this story and it was so boring, and everybody said it was going to be boring. And for some reason that mother was going to HRS because she sat up in that chariot and did like bad things. And then I dreamt that some truck driver put this big stone tunnel in our driveway for some reason and that he wanted me to crawl through it and see something. And I told him I didn’t want to because of the book we read."
315,"Woke up at : AM this morning dreaming Phil was furious w/ me. He took Peter and Eli with him to the movie after saying he wasn’t hungry so the kids grabbed some junk food and left w/ him. Then Eli appeared back home. He was so frustrated! He said they had just started to see the movie when “Dad” said he was hungry and they left. Eli said he was full so he got dropped off. We were sitting in the dark on a couch. I heard Phil’s car coming up driveway, stop, open back door, I know he is coming to kill me. My heart is racing as he creeps in he reaches around me and and grabs me on each shoulder. I kiss Eli’s lying right next to me. Then I tell him I’m calling the sheriff—he’s not his self. I ask if he wants to do the talking. He says yes, he asks sheriff if they have many preachers their sarcastically, no, well you’d better come get me on insanity charge. I live on Cedar Lane  He said it so fast. No! No! You gave them the wrong address! Someone drives up, a couple, and Phil goes out. I call sheriff again and try to communicate the urgency—I’m afraid, very afraid. He might kill me, or kids—where is Peter? Oh my God, has he hurt Peter? I’m terrified of what he is going to do. I ask them not to use siren because it will “trigger” him also I’m afraid he will “charm” them convince them he’s O.K., use his “Dr.” title to influence them and get released. Then what? Terror. "
316," Last night I dreamt that Mom and I were grocery shopping. I can’t remember what all we got, but I remember we were getting loads and loads of stuff. And we got these cookies, we got a bag full of these cookies; some were white and some were chocolate-covered. And they were supposed to represent Celine Dion’s songs in some way. I guess when you eat them you’re supposed to like think about the song or something. And the white cookies had like wine in them. And the black cookies had peanut butter in them. And so we’re in the line checking out in the check-out line and for some reason or another I start talking on the wireless microphone, and my voice can be heard on the grocery store PA system. And then the lady next to me in line started talking too. And then it starts making feedback and I shut it off. And I put it in the basket, and we go out of the store."
317,"OK I only remember a few bits about this dream... At one point I am at this movie theater about to see a movie, I had just come from seeing one. And then I decided I didn't want to go to another movie. I was leaving and had a shopping bag in my hand, with some red tennis shoes in them. I was thinking about how they would match what I was wearing at that moment. Then I start walking down the stairs. Now if you have a big flight of stairs to go down and you go down really fast, it's almost like you get this rhythm going and kinda glide down the stairs, I love that. Anyway that's what I was doing in the dream it felt really weird, and this guy next to me was doing the same thing in rhythm with me. Then I get to the last step and just about bust my ass. Go figure. I walk outside and I am in Old Towne Alexandria. Then suddenly I am at my mom's house. She is standing right beyond the basement door. I walk in and she points up to the wall and there are these mirrors there and they are cracked. Also it appears it actually is not my mom but this chick I used to work with named Rosanne. She was explaining what we would have to do tomorrow to fix it. I wasn't looking forward to this. She pointed down to the ground where there were other mirrors that we would use to replace them, some other guy was there too. Then I am getting ready to leave and someone had suggested when I come back tomorrow  that I bring my laptop and get everything ready in the basement while we are fixing the mirrors. I pretty much got mad at this saying that would take forever and I would do it the way I thought was best, that I didn't want to be wasting time... What the fuck? Anyway then Roseanne says, ""Ok cya tomorrow?"". I say, ""Yeah at the regular time."" Then she says ""Ok so see you at what :?"" and I say ""No, Roseanne you know I come in at , see you then"". That's all I remember."
318," Last night I had a dream that it was Easter Sunday and we were going to go somewhere; I wasn’t really sure where. But I was having Mom help me find that pretty Easter dress from Dad, and I don’t know what would happen. I put the Easter dress on and we went, and we ended up at the beach with like, I couldn’t figure if it was Kristen, Michelle or Aunt Joyce or somebody else. I couldn’t figure who it was. But I took the dress off and I started swimming naked, and I got out dripping wet. And I can’t remember for sure, but I think Mom was playing the “Wee Sing” tape on the little flat tape recorder. And I got out and I scared the ladies and I was buck naked. And then I went over by Mom and Dad and dried off. Then I remember we went home and I told Mom that I felt comfortable playing the “Wee Sing” tape, but only when we were sitting down for dinner and we weren’t up doing a whole bunch of other stuff. And she wanted to hear it again, so we put it on my sound system on the big machine. And we were sitting there listening to it in the dark, watching the LED jump with the rhythm, and then we went to lay down in my bed, but it was still on the system. And then it stopped and somehow it went to tuner and started playing some rap song from .. And I said, “Come on, I’m going to go shut it off.” And I had her come walk with me and hold my hand, and with my other hand I shut the stuff off. And then I woke up. That was weird."
319," The first dream I had, I dreamt that we were going to see a movie with Donia Gloria and some other people, and Donia Gloria kind of let us into the theater. We got the cheap seats, like in back, but she had us move up front kind of at the last minute because nobody showed in a couple of those seats. And she gave me this magnifier thing to look at the TV through, to somehow make it bigger, but it made it a little bigger, but it was more blurrier. And it was about the Little Mermaid and how she, it was kind of a variation of the original, and somehow I had the notion that Samuel Wright, which is the voice of Sebastian, was in a wheelchair. I don’t know how I got that idea; maybe I’m psychic. And I don’t remember too much about what happened in the movie. But my second dream, I dreamt that Mom was listening to different conversations with a scanner. I’m laying in bed here. And I was trying to listen in on them too, but I was kind of afraid of the thing and I didn’t want to get too close to it. And then she turned it onto the FM band for some reason and it was me saying ., but it was like ultra tinny and ultra bleahhh, because it was made only for voices, and here it isfull range signals. Well, that’s that. Goodbye."
320," Last night I had a dream that I was at school and somebody was telling me about this little island with a sound studio on it called San Palmy and Uncle Larry happened to be vacationing there. And we were going to see him for his birthday. And also we were going to see the sound studio, and I had heard like lots of good things about it and stuff. And so we went there, and we were laying on a blanket, we were drinking stuff in a park. And I had Yoohoo out of a plastic bottle, and then we were going to go see Uncle Larry and then I woke up. I never got to see the sound studio either. "
321,"Fire ants on Water Faucets. I go to turn the water on outside in the pool to raise the  level, but fire ants have built hills up over the faucets. I am trying to scrape them down with a screw driver but my fingers get stung  when I touch the hill—they don’t swarm on my hand just burn the parts of my fingers wrapped around the screw driver when they come in contact w/ the hill. I know I need a shovel from the store which I don’t have. Then Lynn walks over to a dead bush  pulls it up and immerses it in the pool. I am angry with her and tell her “you are just being stubborn, I have already replanted the twig once for doing that and you are getting the pool water dirty!” . She runs off crying I ask Phil if he thinks I was right and he agrees, he says I was right. Later I see Lynn still crying coming out of the house with Kim they are leaving. I call to Lynn and run over and tell her I didn’t mean to upset her so much. Kim directed Lynn, “Say what needs to be said!” "
322," I had a bizarre dream last night. I dreamt that I was in a hotel room with Jack and Polly. We were getting ready to sleep but I couldn’t go to sleep, and I was like taking my shoes off and getting off into a recliner lounger that was sitting on top of two beds, straddling two beds. I was like wiggle, wiggle, wiggling around, and then I fell asleep and then I woke up and it was the next morning. Jack and Polly gave me this “Wee Sing” CD/ DVD-like thing and I was kind of afraid to look at it and stuff, and it played in my, you know, that Spanish thing, that Spanish dictionary. It played in the card slot. And then next thing I knew, it was on TV and they were alike singing songs like on the other “Wee Sing” tapes, except it showed them like playing in their tree house and stuff. And I know there was more to it, but I can’t remember."
323," Last night I had a dream that I was going to Spain with Ms. Hammond again and we were leaving Friday, and then I wasn’t even packed. And I was like trying to mix something with an odd-looking mixer – it was like a box mixer – and there were like three VCR’s and a TV and I was mixing some audio. And Mom was like complaining that I wasn’t doing the faders right or something, so I got up and I left. I shut everything off and I left, and I walked around the park and then I came back and I told Mom that when she did that, it reminded me of when I was in Mass Media and stuff, and I started mixing it again and then I slowly faded into consciousness, kind of like a fading in and out the audio. "
324," Last night I had a dream that I was at Grammy’s house in my relative’s home town and that we had stayed for about a week and that we were going home, and I hadn’t gone upstairs yet, and I decided I wouldn’t. And then all of a sudden I was at school and I was like going in during the summer time and getting something for somebody, and I didn’t want to go up the hallway on the east side because it was like totally dark, so I went on the west side and went up to Mrs. H.’s room, talked to her for a little bit and then came down. And then descended the stairwell, which was totally in the dark for some reason. And then I was in the living room decorating this fan, you know like the fan we have in the living room that is portable? Well, I was decorating it with like these sequins that were supposed to represent  files in some way. And there were light bulbs inside the fan that lit up, and Mom was suggesting to me that there were light bulb sockets on the outside and that I should take them off and put them on the outside. And then there was this light-up frog. I couldn’t tell if it was a frog or an owl, and Mom was talking to me about somebody who gave it to me, and I was holding it like from the bottom, and this fan-thing inside of it like turned on and made a wind. I threw it down and it went dark, and then I woke up. How bizarre! How bizarre! "
325," I dreamt that I was going to some kind of a concert show thing at school and Elizabeth and I were in the auditorium with the sound person. And he was showing us this light-up light system where the lights light up, and they’d like turn blue and the theater floor would actually like tip back and forth and back and forth to the rhythm of whatever was going on. And then the strobe light part would turn on and it would just go all out of control, and hopefully nobody was up walking around at that time, because they’d just fall down. And then we went out of the auditorium and we each had rooms there that we were staying in – it wasn’t really a hotel, but it was a place where people could stay. And I was looking for the bathroom, and I found it and I went in, and it was like this real loud engine motor thing in there, kind of like when you go in a plane bathroom. And then I was in my room, which looked like my room here. Oh, I know why we were staying there. We were staying there because we were going to take the SAT. Dad said, “Call the office on the intercom and see if the SAT was ready to start any time soon.” And so I looked around and didn’t see a thingy. Then, I spotted one way at the top. So I got the stool out of my closet, and I climbed up there and buzzed the office, and there was no reply, and then I woke up."
326," Last night I had a dream that we had a swan in our back yard, a mother swan and she had three babies. And for some reason, the chicken killed the baby. And everybody was mad at the chicken. Whenever somebody would see the chicken, they’d shoo her and stuff like that. And then I had to go to the bathroom and Mom was telling me to go across the street to the hotel and go up to the second floor and go in and use their bathroom, and I said, “Why can’t I just use ours?” So I went around in the front and our double doors were much more ornate than they really are, and I knocked on them and pounded on them until finally she came and opened them. And I think I had the notion that I missed a class again in this dream. And that’s really all there was to it."
327,"Ok I had a dream about Mike  last night. FYI Mike is a GREAT friend who lives in canada and a kick ass artist. Mike was having a gallery opening and I was going to go. This would be our first meeting as well. I walk into the gallery and I first look around at the pictures on the wall. The gallery is like this really HUGE room, it's square and there are pictures hanging around the perimeter. The walls are black, the floor is white and the ceiling was orange. Oh my. Anyway the pictures that were hanging were all of mike's dog Taco, however they were all different. Then I look over and see Mike standing in the corner talking to someone. He happens to look up and sees me standing there. He immediately walks over, I can actually feel the adrenalin at this point it was wild and quite vivid, he walks up to me and lays a big kiss on me, truly awesome it was. Then he says something to the effect that he was very glad to finally meet me, and then I woke up. This one was very vivid and clearer then most, although it was not lucid. Had it been we would have been doing it right in the middle of the art gallery because I would have taken it upon myself to attack Mike. :) "
328," Last night I dreamt that for some reason we were up in my relative’s home town visiting family, and we were in this restaurant that was called Celine Dion’s Restaurant. And we were coming up the steps and we saw her get out of a limousine and I shook hands with her. And then we went in the restaurant to sit down and eat, thinking she’d come in the restaurant, but she didn’t. We never saw her again. We went to this area that supposedly the family owned, and it was, it had this little nativity scene thing set up, and we were looking for the baby Jesus in the nativity scene, and we were like unlocking the manger, looking in there, and we didn’t see it. And there were a bunch of tropical plants and things around, and then all of a sudden I was at school, taking the elevator to the third floor; I don’t know exactly why, but I guess I had to talk to somebody. Later on, when I was at home, Dad said that he wanted to have some of that land that the family owned, and Uncle Fred was kind of like how he wanted most of it, and… ."
329," Last night I had kind of a crazy dream. I dreamt that Mom and I were in ToysRUs and something struck us. We saw this Mermaid doll that was advertised, it was like it was a human doll holding Sebastian. She was in a box that advertised, “Come to the store at  on Thursday morning and we’ll take us to see The Little Mermaid at the City Performing Arts Center.” So we picked up that box, and we picked up a little wind-up helicopter for Bobby for Christmas, and I dreamed Bobby was still a little boy. And we picked up one or two other things; I forgot what they were. Then all of a sudden I was in school and watching Devil Vision and saw that it had changed majorly. And they were giving us these little newspaper on civil rights, and so we just walked around to see how it had changed. And we found out that they were doing things a lot more on computers, and that the computer had taken over my job as the sound person and the b-roll job and the director’s job. The only thing that needed to be somebody monitoring the VCR and somebody anchoring. And the board was kind of like off limits to everybody. And next thing I knew, I was back in there and they needed a sound person right away and I was doing the sound for this show. And I did it and I was real careful not to let it over-modulate, and of course the librarian was standing right there. And soon after that I woke up."
330," Last night I felt like I was dreaming an epic. First of all, I dreamt that we had this certain CD that was called the “Concert ” CD because that’s a classical music station in the area, but it played like the Dove . and it even said that on it a few times. And it would play like the station does; it would play about  minutes or so of songs and then about  minutes of “Bleah, bleah, bleah.” And I was thinking how odd that was, and I was thinking it must have been they sent us in the mail. And then I dreamt that there was this other blue and white CD that I couldn’t find the case for, and it was supposed to be something like Snow White soundtrack or something like that. And then I dreamt that I was putting two of them in a bag, like you do at the bookstore. I was putting like Eva’s Mo Jo with the Concert  and the blue and white one with Mariah Carey or something and two other Mariah Careys together and so on and so forth, thinking that maybe I was going to organize them better. And then I dreamt that Mom had paint up the kazoo in the bathroom closet, and I was looking through them and half of them hadn’t even been opened. It was like a stockpile for a store or something. It was totally ample. And I suggested that she move her tape rack into the bathroom and get a CD rack for her work room. And then the rest of it was a whole slurry of activity and stuff, and just basically all kinds of stuff."
331," I had kind of a dumb dream last night. I dreamt that we had bought an SUV like minivan-like type thing, and it had this multi-band receiver that was like a scanner thing that could also receive FM signals. And I was like, “Whoopee, wow, look at this,” and I was sitting there trying to figure it out while we’re on the way over.  What is wrong with this tape? Anyway, we were on the way to the fire station, and when we got there, it stopped for a minute. I don’t know why it did that. But anyway, we got over there and I was like walking in this boardwalk and Dad was showing and talking to his buddies and showing them this, and by that time it had turned into the green truck that we have now, and he was going to start the engine and show how good this sound system sounded and stuff. And he started the engine and it wouldn’t start. Uh oh, it was a rotten egg. "
332," Last night I dreamt that both the house and the car had just gotten an alarm because somebody was paranoid about burglars breaking in. Well, after that I was paranoid about the thing going off. First of all, in the car we were kind of afraid to turn on the radio, we were afraid to move or anything, and because, you know how that goes, and there was a little click when it turns on and another little click when it turned off, and we weren’t really sure exactly which was which. And in the house I was afraid for people to come to the door and ring the doorbell, and so on and so forth. And I dreamt that I was going to stay up late and bake cookies for Mike and Chelsea, and then they come over, which is even better, and then they come in and fortunately the alarm doesn’t go off. And we roll out the dough and I start cutting out cookies, and then I fade into consciousness. "
333," I had a really neat dream last night. I dreamt that we were in Canada for some reason and it was kind of at night time. And it was Mom and Elizabeth and Chelsea and I, and we were in this boutique in Canada, and it had roundish brick steps on the front. And we were looking for a prom dress for Chelsea, and we didn’t really see anything we wanted, we weren’t impressed, but we said, “Let’s hang around a little bit because Celine Dion might drop in.” And sure enough, we were just getting ready to head out the door and we saw her. And she went in and she got something from the boutique, and then she was like so happy to see me, as if she knew me or something. And we went in Elizabeth’s van and she was driving, and Chelsea, Celine and I were like on opposite sides of the seat, and Chelsea was in the middle typing on her laptop computer, and Celine and I were like holding hands over the back of the seat. And I was asking her about things that she had, and she said that she had this cup that was really, really special to her from her sister, and she keeps it up high so her baby won’t grab it and break it. And we get to this hotel thing, and we get out and it’s like all dark, we’re like creeping through the dark. Oh no, first we’re in the kitchen at our house and she’s like, Celine is like walking around holding hands with me and sitting on the couch, and sitting with me like Aunt Joyce and I do. And Mom said, “You better not be turning out to be a lesbian with her.” And then next thing I know, we’re in this hotel like in the dark, and I’m asking her about her songs and things. And we kind of like lose each other, and then I woke up."
334," This dream isn’t very significant and I’m running out of tape, but I have a feeling it will mean something some day, so here we go. Last night I dreamt that we at this theater like Performing Arts Center, and this black usher lady was talking to the sound technician to see if she could get us a little closer to the board. And the sound technician says, “Well, I’m not the one to talk to, but I know this area is reserved for military people.” And so Mom and Dad recommended that I just go to my seat, which was at at the far end of the balcony where I really sat to see the Zarzuela . So I started climbing the stairs, and I got to the third floor, and there were living habitations up there with bedrooms and bathrooms and stuff. And somehow I knew that people lived up there. And I got so lost and so turned around up there that I just, I looked out the window and I was talking to Mom and Dad, I was like almost in tears. And they said, “Just come on down the stairs and we’ll be outside.” So then I was outside, and this was really weird. I was swinging on this swing, and pulling myself up and climbing the ropes and singing, “Can You Feel the Love Tonight,” trying to get up to this little platform thing. And then I woke up."
335,"I only remember bits and pieces of this dream. In part of it I remember I was going to start going back to my old church and was very happy about it . I also remember drugs being involved in the dream but can't remember specifics. The only specific part I remember was near the end. There were these  guys, the both looked familiar. They had this candy, which was kinda like gummi bears. I saw them each eat one and walked up and asked what it was. They told me it was LSD and then gave me one. Then I looked at this one guy, I can see his face clearly in my memory, and I told him that I had never done acid before so that if I did it I would want to make sure I was around people til it wore off. He went on to say a few things, no idea what, and then told me to only eat half of it. So I ate half. Then I remember sitting down and I saw my pastor walk by. LOL Then I started moving my hand and saw all these trails of color following my hand. Then in real life my cell phone rang and I woke up! DAMN!"
336," I had a bizarre dream last night. I must have had too much root beer or something last night. Well anyway, I dreamt that we were at somebody’s house – I don’t know whose – they had a pool though. And in an effort to scare me, they put a bottle full of YooHoo, they made it in a plate with black ice and then they put a fork and knife behind it like the cross bone, and they put that out by the pool. And then all of a sudden we were at our house and Dad was laying on the floor sleeping, and I thought maybe he wasn’t breathing or something. And Mom was like, “Call !” And so I called and was talking to the dispatcher and I was doing okay until I came to the symptoms, and I just kind of froze and I passed the phone over to Mom. And we were laying in the bed in the dark, and by the time Mom was finished to them, while she was still on the phone, the guys arrived. And it was Lee Hanks, Mark Waters and some other guy we know. And then next thing I knew we were in the hospital and we found out there was nothing wrong; he was just sleeping. But I was all distraught over the fact that he was going to crab and complain as to why did I call when I didn’t need to. And the doctor who took time out of his schedule to check him out and see if there was anything wrong rigged a sound board in front of somebody’s yard, like a booby trap, knowing that I would go up to it and check it out. Well, he rigged it so it would go, “Whoop, whoop, whoop,” and so all kinds of sirens and “yoo hoo” and stuff when I went up to it, but somebody we know cut the wires so that didn’t happen, and I went up to it and I checked it out in this person’s front yard, and I turned it on and it started doing what it was supposed to do. And there was like this live concert that I was mixing in this person’s yard, as I faded into consciousness. "
337," Understandably this is the night before exams, so I had an exam dream last night. I dreamt that I was going to school to take my two exams, and first of all Mom was late getting out of the house and I was late to my Spanish exam. And then I dilly-dallied around and I was real late, and I don’t remember anything about how that went. But then I was stopped by Mr. Kunz after my Spanish exam was over, and had to sit down in his class. And he gave the exam which I had never been in his class one day this year. And in his class his exam was very weird. It was like philosophical, and he had these things where, these questions where you, in order of the alphabet you sing the scale and it corresponds to certain letters and you’re supposed to sing the pattern, sing the letters, and then recognize the pattern and then sing some other letters and see which ones make the pattern. That was weird. And the whole time I was taking that exam I was missing Ms. Hanson’s exam, so that’s my exam dream."
338," I had a semi-bizarre dream last night. I dreamt that I was making a CD for somebody and I was in my room and it was nighttime and it was dark and the LED for my sound system shone brighter than the sun. And my porcelain dolls were like I had tons of them and they all had little spotlights on them that were mounted on the edges of the shelves and that were so neat. And there was this orange spotlight on my sound equipment and this doll of Celine Dion that was sitting in like a teacup on top of my sound CD burner, and the body was like a small baby doll, but the head was like not in proportion. The head was like the head of like Celine Dion’s age, and it had her hair and everything. And I took the doll out of the teacup and then I realized I was making the “Falling Into You” CD, recopying it, and I had the doll on my lap and the doll was much bigger. Again, the body was like a baby doll and the limbs got a little bit longer, but the head was like of Celine Dion’s age and it looked just like her. And somehow I had the notion that in order to move forward and backward on the CD, I had to like squeeze her hand, one or the other, to go forward or backward like instead of the skip buttons on the unit. And it was totally bizarre, and before I knew it, this doll was talking to me and stuff. Hmmmm, that was weird. Maybe it was because we were looking through Mom’s dolls and stuff, and we saw her Corky doll that was like gay. "
339," I had a dream last night. I dreamt that the area to the west side of the house was much bigger, and Dad had made like a little petting zoo. And there was this one thing with this stone wall and this railing like they have at Sycamore Gardens, and there was a little pond with about three or four mallard ducks in it. And there was one duck that somehow got outside the little area, that they had like an island of sand and then a little pond for them like they do at Sycamore Gardens for the flamingos. Well, I took some bird seed out of a can and I had climbed up on the wall, and I was giving the ducks some bird seed. And Dad said that I used up all the cereal that wasn’t wet with milk, and I said I had given them some lettuce too. And I can’t remember what else we had back there, and I can’t really remember too much more about my dream. I remembered something else. I was laying on the bed naked with Clark, and Clark was asking me like, “Can I touch your boobs?” And I told him, “No, of course not,” in kind of a joking manner, but he was like trying to touch me anyway. And I was like pulling his hand away and stuff. And then he tried to touch me down lower, and I took my seat and I clawed his hand and his other hand was coming towards his chest and I bit it. And then we started like wrestling and stuff, and somehow I managed to keep him away from me. But next thing I knew I was drawing this mummy ?_ picture and I was hearing Mom and Dad talk about trying Clark for doing that. That was bizarre! "
340,The ONLY thing I remember about this dream was finding out Sully Erna from Godsmack had died. I remember crying about it. That's it.
341,"Ok I remember a few things about this dream. First I was back home in my mom's house. I remember my brother was back. I was so happy to see him and remember asking him if he was going to call Cory and Darren and let them know what he was infact ALIVE and not dead . I remember being really excited. Then there was another part of the dream where I was back in my highschool. I walk into class and this guy Kevin England was sitting in a desk. . Anyway I said hi Kevin and introduced myself because I didn't think he would remember me. Even though we were back in highschool it was present time, I was not a teenager again. Then Mike, a good friend of mine, walks up as I am talking to Kevin. He takes my hand and shyly asks if I want to go to some cookout or something with him. I asked him if it would be just the  of us and he said no that his family would be there as well. I told him I would go, he seemed happy. It was as if he was asking me out on our first date. Then I am suddenly in my mom's house. We are going to go out or something and I need to find something to wear. I am in my old bedroom looking through clothes. They were all hanging up on the door, some of them were wet as if they had just come out of the wash. I remember seeing this one shirt that was white with red and black markings all over it, it was kinda like a really nice Adidas T-shirt or something. I was gonna wear that but then I saw my black Cohiba  t-shirt  and grabbed that as well. Then I realized I needed to put on some deoderant before I put on my clothes. I go in my moms bathroom to see if she had any. After searching I found some ""Dry Idea"" roll on. I start to roll it on and the little ball that ROLLS fell out. LOL Anyway that's all I really remember. How exciting."
342," I had a pretty bizarre dream. First, let’s see, I was at school and I was missing Mrs. H.’s class, first because I got lost in the hallway, second of all because Elizabeth and Mrs. Hildebrand stopped me and were talking, and then I took my clothes off and was taking a bath in the school bathroom. And then I was trying to figure out how to get back to Mrs. H.’s class, but then all of a sudden I was at home and we were setting up this strange answering machine that worked in concert with the computer. And first when we set it up, it requested that you pour a quart of water into it, which was totally bizarre. And so we did, and then the computer started up and went through its start-up procedure, and when it gets to the part where you see the Windows symbol before the desktop comes up, we saw this like colorful color pattern, like one of my tops that’s real colorful, and this color pattern just kind of stayed there. And somehow I had the notion that we had to give this answering machine food that we ate and samples of our blood and information."
343,"Ok I am sure I will screw up the order of this dream because i don't quite remember what happened when. First I remember being with some girls, I believe one was my best friend Chyrise. We were going to fly to california. Can't remember why but it was to put on some type of show somewhere. I remember we got the tickets and our flight. We were driving in the car and a guy named Richard came up and handed us  tickets that would get us to cali and back for $, gotta like that. I go home to get ready and I first need to make sure my cats will have enough food. They have a self feeder and self waterer that you can fill up for days at a time. So I go to check their food and notice some of the food is in the water dish so I clean that out. Then I notice that in their food dish there are a bunch of M&Ms . Their cat food was quite colorful too. So I cleaned out all the M&Ms thinking the cats shouldnt eat chocolate. Then I remember seeing some bugs on the ground and as I looked around the house i kept seeing more. Then I am freaking out cuz i think i can't go to california with all these bugs in my house i will come back and they will have taken OVER. So my friend Chyrise stops by and I tell her I can't go. Then she helps me track down how these bugs may be getting into the house. We look at the window and see that it's wide open with no screen. AHH There is the culprit. Then suddenly all these bugs appear  of them are like giant palmetto bugs  except they were like  / FEET long... oh my god they were so big. I also saw some bugs I have never personally seen before, they were all marching towards the window as if to leave. We now are in my car except some guy is with me. I look in my rear view mirror and an undercover cop has his lights on and is pulling us over. It was a big white lincoln or so it seemed. I knew I didn't have my COUNTRY sticker yet because it's a new car and I have procrastinated. So I knew i was going to get nailed. I also had some POT in my purse so got all nervous about that. Well suddenly we are no longer on the side of the road but in some parking lot. The cop comes over and says he is going to check out to make sure the car wasn't stolen. So while we are waiting we get out of the car and talk with some other people that are there. Finally the cop lets me go, no harm done. That's all I remember. police "
344,Don't remember the details at all I just know it was about my brother.
345,"Ok I remember bits and pieces of this dream one part stands out in particular. I am walking down this hallway with a bunch of other people, almost like the hallways are in highschool between classes. I am walking with some young girl, she looks indian . Puff Daddy is walking behind me and makes some comment about her. This pisses me off because she is just a child and he is a grown man. I turn around and get in his face, literally. I was pointing my finger in his face and telling him how dare he treat a young girl that way. How would he like it if he had a daughter and someone said those things to her?  All he did was look at me and didn't say anything. I remember turning around and walking off hoping, for some reason, I would run into him again later. I remember another part of the dream where I was at my mom's house and was going to go use her shower. As I am going into the bathroom I remember noticing that people are in her bed. I can't see who cuz they were under the covers. Turns out it was my mom and her boyfriend Loy."
346," Last night I dream that we were camping and our family was like it was when I was little. I don’t know exactly how old I was. I must have been little too, I just didn’t feel little. I was acting like I was big. But I felt little compared to the others.  Well anyway, we had Sheryl and Sandra, but we also had three boys instead of just Sam. We had a big boy named Steven, like in his ’s, we had a big Sam, about  or so and we had a little Sam who was like  or . And the two big boys were alright; the girls were kind of reserved and shy like I was probably at that age. And the big boys were okay; they were like, I always saw them in camouflage and they would go hunting and stuff and fishing in the woods and stuff. The little Sam was scary, though. He had red hair and he would run around. He was a boisterous little thing. And, you know, I think I saw him near the keyboard a few times. He was carrying it around and running through the woods with it. And I can’t remember too much about what happened during the dream or anything. I just remember that whenever the little Sam was around, I was really scared. And that’s all I can remember. [Mom: I think you can identify with the big Sam, because he’s your big brother that you talk to on the phone with music and stuff. But the little Sam is the little guy that scared you with the noises when you were little, and in your dream you’ve kind of combined both of them because they always, there was a while there where Sam and Ronnie were wearing camouflage and they were big boys compared to you when you were little. "
347," I had a very significant dream last night and I think it’s perfectly explainable, but it’s one of those that’s like near and dear to my heart, even though it was extremely embarrassing if it had really happened in real life. Okay, I can’t remember any of the miscellaneous that were going on beforehand and some other little side dreams, but I do remember the main part. I dreamt that I had been practicing on the keyboard and I had it plugged in with an AC adapter to the extension cord under my dresser, and it was set up on top of its box on the bed so that I could stand up straight and sing, but still be able to see the keys like I did that one time when they were at the movies. And all the lights were off in the bedroom and I was talking to Mom in her work room. And I go in the bedroom and I turn the lights on, but for some reason, me turning on the lights powers up that extension cord underneath my dresser – it doesn’t really, but it did in my dream. And having power at that AC adapter powered up the keyboard, even though I didn’t turn it on. And that familiar robot voice that greet us and I was like, “Oh my gosh, you mean to tell me I didn’t put it away?” And so, and then it said, “Select a song.” And then it starts playing this song because, see, in real life it can do this song demonstration thing, and when you activate it, it says, “Select a song.” So we did that, but it started playing this song to demonstrate, but it was like a Celine Dion song from .. That was kind of cool. And then Mom wanted me to teach her how to do some things and teach her about the notes of the staff and all, so I turn it off for a minute and I go to my desk and I draw a five-line staff and I start labeling the lines and spaces on scrap paper. And I’m ready to go back and give it to Mom and start teaching her, and next thing I know, she’s back in her room sorting her papers and I missed my chance to teach her and show her. And then I woke up, and I was so mad when I woke up. I think I had this dream that I missed a chance to show her something because I don’t want to be too stuck on a one-track mind. I’ve been thinking a lot about that lately, and I’ve been practicing on it every chance I get when there’s nobody in the house. And I really am dying to show Mom some music theory and stuff, but I don’t want to just, I’m so shy, and it’s like when I bring this thing out and am practicing on it, I swear I’m never going to tell anybody. But I always end up telling Mom anyway. "
348," Last night I dreamt that it was my last day of school again. First I dreamt that I had to clean out my locker, so I had to carry several notebooks and this stuffed Kermit the Frog around school all day because my locker was going to be cleaned out. And I dreamt that I was skipping Mrs. H.’s class in the courtyard. And then they announced that everybody has to report to the auditorium for a really formal assembly and they were going to talk about the history of man and radio or something like that, and they said, “If you don’t have formal enough clothes to wear, stop by and we’ll give you some.” So we headed on over there and we were hearing the sound check in the auditorium, and then I woke up, never did – oh, and suddenly I realized I was naked, so I’m walking around topless with newspaper kind of around my bottom. So I heard the sound check in the auditorium and then I woke up. I wasn’t able to even get in there."
349,"Oh god this dream was all over the place. First I remember being at my mom's house but don't remember that much about it. Then I remember I was no longer at her house and wanted to call her. I pulled out my cell phone and tried to dial her number. I couldn't seem to get through. Finally I got through but it was as if she couldn't hear me we weren't able to have a conversation. Although in the dream I felt like she was deliberately ignoring me and it got me upset. So I tried calling her back and couldn't get the number right. When I looked at the number I dialed I remember seeing  something... when in fact her number is -etc... This was a CLEAR dream sign yet I wasn't able to figure out I was dreaming. grrrrr. Next I am in the airport with my old friend Tammy and someone else. As we are walking through the airport I remember these  black people were getting ""tarred and feathered"". You heard right. I felt very disturbed at what I saw, I didn't think it was right. Next thing I know I have a coat of tar on my arms and legs. I am basically walking around the airport and my arms and legs have this thing coat of black tar on them. I figured once it dried I could get it off. Then I start to pull it off my arm and it was coming off as if it were Liquid latex, for those who know what that is. So I am rolling this tar off my arm and remember seeing the hair coming off with it, however it didn't hurt at all. Then I started on my legs, I don't remember getting it all off but I must have. Next there was this scene where a car had gotten flooded and my purse with our tickets and stuff were in the car, someone got in the car to retrieve my stuff. I remember being very upset because some photos that were in my purse were destroyed. Finally we realize we are gonna mis the plane. We found one of the guys that drives old people around in the airport and ask him to give us a ride to the gate. He gives us a ride to the escalator and tells us to go down that the gate would be there. We get down there and there is one gate but it's not the one we needed. We were looking for  or  can't remember. Some guy told us it was one way, then another guy said no it's that way, leading us down some dark hallway, I remember feeling very uncomfortable. Then suddenly I am in my house. I remember hearing this loud noise coming from across the hall, I looked through the peep hole and saw that my neighbors were having some party, there were all these people in their living room. Then I remember someone opening my front door, I stood in front of it so they couldn't open it all the way, it freaked me out cuz the door is locked. I peek out and see my brother. He looks like he had been rolling around in dirt or something LOL he was quite dirty. I immediately started crying.  He asked if he could come in, I was hesitant cuz my condo was messy LOL but I told him he could, he walked in and some guy came in behind him. I was like ""No only you."" so he had to wait out in the hall. That's all I remember."
350," Last night was totally whacked, man. I dreamt that I was walking around with an IFB box clipped to my belt, and I had a set of headphones on, and I had two microphones, one in each hand. One was a lavalier clip one and one was like a wired heavier one. And I was talking to people and people were talking to me. And the level in my ears was like really loud, and I was trying to figure out how to turn it down so I wouldn’t feel so nervous. And instead of turning it down, I turned it up and it was even louder, and I just couldn’t control it after that. And I was like walking around the back yard with this stuff and stuff. And then I dreamt that I was going to create a mermaid poster show, like a mermaid audio show with topic figures, and I was going to use all my voice except Flounder was going to be a kind of my voice at a faster speed. My voice in real time was going to be Ariel, my voice slowed down a little bit was going to be Sebastian, and my voice slowed way down was going to be Triton. And I was going to like make these figures on a cardboard and make them go around the stage and play this strange audio. And I was thinking how I was going to write all the music and stuff for it and everything. And I got to drawing the figures, and then I just kind of woke up. Now maybe that’s a really good idea. I should do that for real now, shouldn’t I? "
351," Last night I had kind of an odd dream. First I dreamt that Dad was doing some kind of remodeling up here, and I not only had a fan with black blades, but I had this air conditioner that was mounted in the ceiling and I was going to control it on the wall with the fan switches. And so I remember I didn’t know how to shut off the air conditioner and I was ice cold, and I was going to tell Mom to come shut it off. And I dreamt that in Mom’s room, she had this rack CD player that was like a box machine that goes with system stuff. And it was kind of silvery and it had a little design in the front. And I was trying to figure how she worked it and stuff. And it wasn’t connected to any amplifiers or anything, so I don’t know how she got sound out of it, but I remember it was pretty, kind of neat, and I was thinking, oh, she could finally play CD’s and maybe she’ll start getting rid of her tapes. And then I dreamt that Mom had a tape of the X Files that I made a CD of so she was getting rid of that tape, and I was thinking of saving it so I could recycle it, but I said naaah. Next I had another little dream, after I figured, I dreamt that I was so ice cold in my dream because the fan was making me cold, so I got up and turned it off. And I went back to sleep and dreamt I was at this fair thing with Mom, and there were these kids over in this one booth that she was watching while their mother went to go do something, and while we were in the bathroom, Mom told me she knew some stuff about Celine Dion, like her address and her phone number, but didn’t want to tell any of us, and I guess because I knew who her baby doctor was, because she blabbed it all over TV. And what do they call that – obstetrician?  But I mean when the baby’s pregnant.   Yeah, that’s what I mean! Anyway, the obstetrician is Dr. Rosenwax – she blabbed it all over TV. But anyway, so there were these ducks and these geese hanging out by these kids and they were so tame. And I was over at another booth doing something, and I was crawling over to the booth where Mom is because there were these air vent gratings in this tent thing, and I was crawling on this tent material over to where Mom was. And then I was just sitting down doing nothing, and I had my mini-disc recorder for WMNF, but I didn’t have the personal CD player. Next thing I knew I was riding home in the car with Tim Dil Peterson, and he was talking to me about editing and stuff, and about – I forgot my personal CD player, but I could have transferred some songs to the mini disc player so I could have one thing to do both jobs. And then I woke up. "

353,"Ok I remember being in this hotel, like in some big conference room. For some reason I remember when we walked in I dropped off my purse at this desk, kinda like a coat check. Then I was in this room with these people, I don't exactly remember what we were doing. Mike was there, and he had to go up to the front of the room and help with this presentation, something about our solar system and the planets. It was odd. Then I remember Mike and I wanted to leave we were in the back of the room and my back was sore so I was sitting on the ground stretching, and he was sitting next to me watching. Then we were getting ready to leave and I remembered that I had to get my purse. Well here is where the dream gets frustrating. I can't seem to find the place I left my purse at. We ask the lady at the front desk and she said it was up one level. Then I get some advil out of my purse and take it because my back is still hurting. We start walking up the stairs and half way up it got confusing because there were  different flights you could take leading to different places. But it just looked odd. Mike insisted we go a certain way so I followed him. Well we still couldn't find it. I was getting mad at this point and a bit frustrated. We went up another flight of stairs, Mike was in front of me and I remember smacking him in the ass. LOL Anyway this flight leads to the outside so I know we are in the wrong place now. It's as if this flight of stairs just came right up to a city sidewalk it was odd. Then we go back down and I remember seeing this asian lady that worked there. I asked here where the hell the coat room was and she was clueless. Then I turn around and see this sign saying where it is. And I turn back around and curse out the lady for not knowing. LOL Then I start down this long all and realize it's way down at the other end. I also realize that I have no idea where Mike went and hope I can catch up with him. I wake up at this point and my back and neck are VERY VERY sore. I must have slept the wrong way or something but it definitely showed up in the dream."
354," I am in Europe. There is my old platoon: young, full-haired, smiling. They welcome me, then complain. It is a bad area. One out of six will die of prostate cancer. It is in the water which spills over large brick buildings; it is in the ground. A young soldier shows me a gem bought from a villager. He regards its beauty and power. I can tell it is fake. The villager, who is middle-aged and wears a business suit, leaves his house. He walks toward me. I throw the gem in his face. “What are you doing?” I say. “This is uranium.” Aloof and calm, he curls his hand around my neck, then releases it. We return to his house. There is the long flight home. I begin planning my escape."
355," Last night, let’s see, I had this terrible dream. I dreamt that I was watching this documentary that I had taped on TV, like this news program or something, and it was Celine Dion at her computer going through some MIDI files on her website and Rene Charles, her baby, was on her lap, and she was explaining to the viewing audience which songs that Rene liked and which ones made him nervous and put him on edge, and which ones he liked. And then as the story went along, it showed him in this, Rene and this car and him getting in this major fiery accident. And  then it showed him like three or four all of a sudden, trying to fight somebody and somebody was trying to attack him as the ambulance was coming. And he was like, “I’m three years old and I know how to use a knife. I can take a sparkler and I can burn you.” And I don’t remember exactly what happened. I was like rewinding the tape and it was like playing it over and over again, and that was weird. And then the phone rang and woke me up."
356," Last night I had this dream that I was DJ’ing the most bummer party ever. Okay, here’s the deal: the Peavey system was set up out in the back yard, and there was a handful of people out there. And I was still inside rummaging g around, trying to get all my CD’s together and stuff. And it took me like a half an hour to an hour to get them all together and ready. And then I came outside and it was dark already and there were some more people. And I was going to, I sat down at my table and I was putting this CD in, and everybody was just kind of totally like they didn’t even hear it, and nobody was dancing, they were just all kind of “duhhhhh,” like they just didn’t even hear it. So I put on something else and I crank it up a little louder, and they still just like kind of “duhhhhh,” like they don’t even hear it. And I can’t remember what I did, but I think I just was totally not ready and my system was cuckooing out on me and stuff, and it was just a real bummer of a party."
357," I am on a combat assault. Only a few of us ride in the chopper. We carry full combat gear: pack, weapon, helmet, ammo. We fly toward the Ivy Hill Apartments. From high up I see buildings which appear like photographs. We land on a rooftop. I see my brother. At the same time I see a horrible sight. I walk toward it. The intact body of an American soldier glows like fireplace embers. His internal organs have hardened to stone and are clearly visible. I shout to my brother, “How did this happen?” He says he doesn’t know. I am standing over the corpse. I can tell my brother is lying."
358," I dreamt that I was at Tyme Gardens with Crystal and Stacy and their gang, except one girl was named Jenn, another girl was named Bush and we were with our kids too. And we stayed on one side of the park that looked like Crescent Lake and then we were at this petting zoo section, but we didn’t go in the section where all the rides and the show and stuff are that I’m familiar with. We mostly just stayed at one end of the park and walked around and stuff. And then we met up with Dad over at the petting zoo section and all the girls went on to do something else, and I was stopping and talking, and I was standing under the post of the fence of the petting zoo and I was talking and she said that there’s this, he was glad we stayed on this side and all. And I was thinking, “Yeah, of course she would be.” And there was this person that was going to do a concert show that was a guitarist from the ‘’s, and I didn’t know the difference in my dream between a gunner and a guitarist, so I kind of thought that guns were like guitars and guitars were like guns. I don’t know why I would think something so whacko. I mean, they’re, I don’t know, they don’t even make a similar sound. Well anyway, and then I dreamt that we were home and I was looking around the house as if it were Tyme Gardens, trying to find stuff, and then I realized I was at home and I shouldn’t even be looking. Then I dreamt that Sheryl, Sandra and Sam were in town, which they were because they were at Tyme Gardens with us. And they were, I mean, I was laying in bed and Sam was like in the shower and he had this tube and he was spraying water at me and stuff. And so I closed the door. Then he came in with a cup of water and I thought he was going to pour it on my head, but instead I like got him in a wrestling hold, and he was like, “Ahhh, you gave me snake bite.” And I was thinking, “What in the world is a snake bite?” And we started like kind of wrestling and the cup of water just kind of went away, and he kept saying, “Ah, you gave me a snake bite!” And then I dreamt that that all went away and I was kind of snuggling with Sandra the way I snuggle with Mom and I was telling, I felt comfortable enough to tell her the story of way we found the keyboard, and I started asking her if she remembered when we had it, and she said, “Yeah, I know. Your mom kept asking us to take it each time we came, and I didn’t want to take it because Dawn  said don’t take stuff from you.” And I was just like, “Okay,” I wasn’t hurt or anything, I mean, I was just sort of like, “Okay.” And I was drawing little bitty pictures in this notebook while I was talking to her. Somehow And I didn’t tell her the rest of the story; I never did. And then I woke up. Oh, and I dreamt that the time said like : and when I woke up it was :."
359," Okay, this is sometime in the middle of July, . Last night I dreamt that I was at Bancroft, but I was in Devil Vision from my high school, and I was sitting there at their board and it had a blue faders except they weren’t uniform all the way across. The mono-mike channels were pots and the rest were blue faders, and I was trying to work this board and we were under a lot of stress to try and get this show done right now, and the librarian was trying to get us to do something. And then the bell rang and Elizabeth came over to me and said that Mrs. H.’s class was going to be in the auditorium. And then all of a sudden the halls and stuff were like at Bancroft, and Mrs. H.’s class was up on this other floor and I had to run up to her room and get my stuff. And then I was like running through the halls to get to the auditorium on time. I had books in my arm, but no bag, and I was running through the halls and I was coming down a stair thing and I fell face first, I was like falling down the stairs and then I woke, and my books went everywhere and I woke up."
360," Last night I had a dream, like Martin Luther King. Well, I’m expecting a surprise visit from my sister Sandra tomorrow, but I don’t know what in the world or when in the world because they won’t tell me. So anyway, I had this dream that Sandra was here and I was telling her the story of we set up the keyboard on the kitchen counter, of all things, and it was white, the body was white and it was twice the size. I put my two hands on it. There was enough span for the bass clef and the treble clef, and I started playing the accompaniment for Easy Like Sunday morning. And Sandra was like, “Wow, girl!” And Dad was out in the yard and he could hear it, and then here comes the really bizarre part. We were getting ready to go to this thing at the city Performing Arts Center and Sandra and Dad wanted to go with us, but I guess they weren’t ready. I was just like in the car in the passenger seat, and the car was just going where I needed it to go. And it was just going on the interstate,  mph and it got off the exit at the right exit, and the only problem I had that it needed to be driven was when it came time to park, and since I wasn’t steering it, it parked kind of cockeyed across three other spaces. And it was twirling around a little tiny bit. And I shut off the ignition just in time before it crashed into something. And oh, when I was on the interstate, I could see around me, everybody in the truck behind me. I could see Mom and Sandra in the truck behind me, and so when I got parked, shortly after that Mom pulled up in the truck. And I had to tell her how cockeyed the car parked, and Sandra was there and I didn’t want Dad to know that I “drove” even though I didn’t drive all by myself. And we were going to race home and get him, but we decided, “Nah,” and I don’t remember too much after that, but I do remember that we were all at this like camp fire celebration with these fireworks going off later on. And then I woke up."
361," Last night I had a bizarre dream . First of all, this was after everybody left and after all the dust settled and I could start remembering my dreams again and I wouldn’t get so tired. I dreamt that I was getting ready for school and I was all dressed and ready to go, and I had my book bag and my books and stuff. It was going to be my first day. And I went in the bathroom to go to the bathroom and there was this faucet on the wall, like opposite the toilet, and there were two of them and they were just spraying water out of control. And I went in there and I got myself all wet. They were spraying after me as I went and I just closed the door and I said, “Alright.” And then I got my shoes and stuff and told Mom about it, and I don’t remember what she said. But that was short-lived. The other weird dream I had was I dreamt that Sheryl and Sandra and I were going through my magic show stuff. And there was this recording of me doing a magic show a long time ago and people cheering and clapping, playing even one of the magic show things. And then I said, “Where is that coming from?” and Sheryl pulled out this mechanical chickie and she said, “This is a magic chick; now watch it.” And it had like a little heart thing on its hand; you know how mechanical things do. And when you would press it, it would say, “Hi, I’m a magic chick. If you want to play magic,” something about the something blue. You’d have to activate a blue king or blue foot thing or something. And then it would say, “Hi, I’m a magic chick, if you want to play magic,” something like that, and then it would start to play this recording of when I would do magic shows. That was like weird. "
362," Last night I had a dream that my birthday was fast approaching. I was at the fire station and they were making me this birthday cake. They like putting roses and stuff and sprinkles and I would go over and snitch some. And they were gearing up for a birthday party for me, but then I remembered that my birthday wasn’t until March, and then what in the world were they doing, getting ready for a birthday for me? And as I was getting my stuff ready to go out the door, the parrot started singing, “Happy birthday,” to me. That was kind of weird. Then I dreamt that I was taking a music class in college, and that this kind of Spanish lady was teaching it. And we were going over some theory and stuff, and she was surprised at how much I knew. And she was saying how she’s going to have to catch me up a little on what I missed. Then I dreamt that there was this battery charger thing that was supposed to absorb the acid if they corroded. It was like a traveling duffel bag, and it was for the keyboard. It was like put the batteries in all in series, and Mom said that it reminded her of cow poop, the way you put them in. And then they would gather  they would provide  volts and then you would plug it into the adapter. And I don’t know, somehow we had the notion that that would make it work. And I woke up before we could test it out."
363," Last night I had kind of a weird, but predictable dream. I dreamt that I was starting school and that things had really, really changed. We were in this auditorium that kind of put me in mind of a cross between Dexter Hampton’s auditorium and the gym at Bancroft. The seats were not just slanted a little bit, but they were like way slanted like bleachers are. And they were different colors like in the Dexter Hampton auditorium, but there was this big, wide open space down in front of the seats that they said for assemblies and stuff they set up a stage. And I had the notion that for chorus class there was going to be this male performer opera singer going to teach it, and for some reason I had the notion that he wasn’t as good, that he was very basic. And I reasoned in my head that the more advanced classes were going to be taught by Mrs. Dougherty, but that this man was going to teach kind of the introductory and beginning and basic classes. And I can’t remember too much, so I woke up."
364," Last night I dreamt that the kids were still in town, and that Sheryl and Sandra I was having such a good time with, and I was really sad about them leaving. But for some reason I was remembering a lot of things in my childhood to do like with Blue Bird and stuff, and I was pacing around upstairs, and I was really nervous. And it seemed that all the girls were taking a shower and Sam was reading, but I came downstairs and I thought I heard Sam playing the keyboard in the bedroom. And I know this is really stupid, but I’m going to have to say it anyway in order so that I can analyze my thoughts later. I dreamt that in order for the keyboard to work, we had to bake a cake, and there was this cake. And everybody would eat a piece of the cake, and when it was all gone, it wouldn’t work any more. And I don’t know what the connection was or why that happened like that, but it was weird. And it wasn’t anything wild like he used to do. He was really sincerely trying to learn a song, and it was the Entertainer song that the ice cream truck plays all the time. And let’s see, I dreamt that we also had a pineapple cake and a pear cake that I really wanted a piece of, but apparently Mom said they had containers that snapped shut and she couldn’t get them open without making a whole bunch of noise. But she wanted to save them for when it was just us, so when I wanted a piece of cake, I had to have the other cake that made the thing work. That is so bizarre. How bizarre; how bizarre. And I also remember that later on I got my school schedule, and we had to whip up this like cake mix in order for my schedule to coincide. And it was this like real powdery, awful-tasting cake mix we just had to whip up, and we had to spread it all over everywhere. And I dreamt that I was going around on my first school schedule and that I stayed back and was talking and talking with Mrs. Dougherty with Mom, and that I missed Math completely, and there was an absence on my first day. And Dad was complaining about it, and we said, “What’s he complaining about now?” And there were these pictures, and there was one of Mrs. Gresham, there was one of Mrs. Hammondand there was one of Mrs. Dougherty. There were these pictures that were like photo pictures, I guess. And Mrs. H.’s was bigger than life, and it was like almost poster size except it was just the head. And she had a blue background, like she had this beaver outfit on like she was this beaver on stage, and her hand was extending off to the side into the next picture. And her hand was extending like almost over the top of the Mrs. Dougherty picture, except you could still see her. It was just that the hand was in the way of the picture. And I dreamt that I was going to enlarge the other one and fix it up and get rid of Mrs. H.’s hand and all, so that hers would be bigger than life. Now I think that could have some meaning to it because Mrs. Hammondis pretty vain and stuff, I think, and  so, I think, and that’s it. That was bizarre, huh?"
365,"Ok this one was weird. I only remember a couple small bits. I am in a city bus and I look out the back of the bus and i see the  flying very low to the ground coming towards us. I have a feeling the plane is deliberately chasing the bus and wants to crash into it. I tell the bus driver to stop so we can get the fuck out! He chooses not to stop which really pisses me off. Instead he turns the corner really have. The plane is now flying at street level and misses the turn but turns at the next street. As we approach the next block i look to the left and see the plane turning the corner slowly and coming at us. That's all I remember about that portion of the dream. Then suddenly I am on the street and there are these men. It appears they had killed everyone in the bus and now wanted to kill me. This one guy told this other guy to kill me and he came towards me with some kind of syringe. I walked backwards away from him and he pushed me around the corner. Then he told me to scream so they would THINK he was killing me and then to run. SO I got away, that's all I remember. "
366," Last night I had one of those stupid dreams I could have sworn I’ve had before. Has anybody ever had some of those? Well anyway, I dreamt that I was sick and that I was going through cards at my desk. And somehow I had the notion that I was in a Bible school for elementary kids. I think that came from Elizabeth’s church and all. But then I had this card that was signed by Celine Dion and I just knew I had to keep it safe with my other memoirs and stuff. And then I had this goofy, goofy card, it said, “Oldies .” and it was like all gold and silver and stuff and it had a hole in the middle where you put – I don’t know – a pin or something. And then I came back in my room and the clock said that it was : or some odd hour of the morning, and one of the LEDs was just totally shot so it didn’t light up. And that’s it."
367," Last night I dreamt that we were having a little picnic in the back yard, and we were playing the “Snake Bite” song, and we had this birthday cake that we were lighting candles on. And apparently a fire got started, a little fire with some of the matches, and Dad was showing me how to put out the fire that distracted me from being scared of the voodoo in the “Snake Bite” song. And then I dreamt that there was this movie that Mom and Dad were going to see. It was in the middle of some kind of a theme park. And how they would do it was, it would be totally, totally, totally dark in the place where they would go and stand, and this mask that they would put on would be blue. And they would not see anything until the movie would come on, and sometimes that would be a little scary. And I don’t remember too much else, but it was kind of fragmented last night."
368," A new tape. Let’s see how good this works. Anyway, I had a dream last night that I was still in Spain. For some reason I’m stuck on a broken record of having dreams about being still in Spain. But anyway, we were still in Spain and we were all roller blading down the street, and then we were going to go see a show of somebody rollerblading. So we got in these escalators and held onto the railings. They went twice as fast as normal ones do. I think maybe even three times faster. We went up four or five of them until we got to like this place where there were chairs for everybody and a little road thing. And I sat on a ramp right in the front, and my feet like dangled into the middle of the road thing, and then Mrs. Hammondtold us that we were too early and we have to come back in a half an hour. And then I had another dream that we were at dinner, and we were eating and eating these things. And I had already had a course, and this Spanish waiter came by with this tray with six compartments in it and gave me two spoonfuls from each compartment, and it was like, “Oh gosh, more to eat?” And I had some water that I was drinking, and then I was offered some vanilla ice cream and it turned out to be milk. And then I had another dream that we were walking around we went in this church. Let me think a minute. I remember more to it now. Some of our group was performing up there and going to sing and play their band instruments, and Chris and Michelle and Lee Hanks were sitting by the sound board, and Michelle was going to run it. And she was showing it to me and showing me all the things about it. And it was silvery with white faders, and it had these little white levers that you could make it say certain words, so you could just like make them say these words. And then the preacher came up and was preaching about these boys that all they wanted to do was fight and broke things up. And there was an image of some men up on the wall and the priest asked, “What would you do if this image wasn’t there?) and these wives would stand up and say, “You stole our husbands’ image.” And then I woke up."
369," Last night I had a dream that I was taking a music theory course with Mr. Hartley and that it was the first day and he wanted us to, I thought that it was kind of near the end of the period and so I got up and I was starting to follow Elizabeth out the door and he’s like, “Hey, where are you going?” And so we sat back down. He put this like practice thing up on the overhead, he gave us each a little notebook about the size of a, about four times the size of a matchbook, and it had little tiny shapes of staff paper in it. It was kind of like a measure note pad, and we were supposed to, except these little pieces of staff paper were like dated and titled and stuff, and we were supposed to keep our little practice things in it. And he was going to collect them, like writing a sharp on this line and putting this something-or-other on that space, and what does this mean, what does that mean and stuff like that. I don’t remember too much about what it was. And I dreamt that instead of doing the practice, I was writing a story in this thing about someone being a very kind and gentle musician and nobody realizing it. And then I woke up. That was kind of dumb, huh?"
370,"I remember Mike and my mom were at my house and wanted to come in. I didn't want them to because my place was a mess.  Anyway I get very stressed over it but not sure what really happened. I do remember this was going to be the first time i met Mike  in person. I was very excited and stressed at the same time. Then I remember going to some reunion. It was like a highschool reunion but not just our class, there were other graduating years there too. I remember having conversations with a couple people, I remember seeing this one chick Julie Nichols who i hated in Jr High and she seemed just as bitchy as she used to be. LOL But it didn't seem to phase me. Then this one girl Stacy and her sister were talking to me. I made some comment and walked off, and then made another comment to someone standing near me about Stacy's sister. She must have over heard, she made some comment back as she was coming towards me riding a bit. Nothing threathening really, just odd. i know the word fuck was used and something about  years but that's all I remember. Then Mike had disappeared and I was looking for him. I was ready to go and couldn't find him. I was stressin, I ran into his brother  and he made reference to him being with his sister because she was having a baby. "
371," Last night I dreamt that I was in this store called Anderson Audio, like Sam works at, and it had audio stuff in it. And I was walking around and looking at different stuff, but I saw a bunch of furniture and stuff in addition to that. Then I went up to the front counter, and the lady at the front was so impressed with me and she was showing me these things that she had in her display case. First she showed me a porcelain music box rocking horse with this saddle that was made out of this really, really soft material, and it was ornate and stuff. And then she showed me this snow globe that was in the shape of a Santa face. It was flat and it was plastic, and when you tip it upside down, the lyrics to “Santa Claus is Coming to Town” – each word was on a little black piece of plastic and they would all just kind of fall into place and be suspended in the water, and you’d tip it upright again. And then lastly she showed me this snow globe that had a cardinal in it, and it was like the one with two cardinals from Merilee that ________. And it was part of that collection. And she gave me the rocking horse and the cardinal for half price, but I wasn’t really interested in the snow globe. And then I woke up."
372," Last night I dreamt that I was going to be the prom DJ, the DJ for the high school prom. And it’s not anywhere near prom time. I don’t know where this came from, but I did participate in a wedding and was the DJ, so maybe that’s it. But anyway, I dreamt that our foyer was like four or five times as big as it really is, and I had my equipment set up and I was lining up CD’s and getting ready because I had the notion that the prom people were going to just start filling up, coming in the house and filling up our foyer. And so I’m getting ready, getting techno stuff together and all, and next thing I know, my equipment won’t work right and I have to have like a long time to like, I’m looking for this certain connector that I need and I can’t find it. For some reason I need a ” mini connection, and I usually don’t use that unless I’m using my boom box, but I wasn’t this time, so I don’t know. Then I suddenly dreamt that – this must have been another one of those dreams that you have that feel like they’re connected – I dreamt that we were at Elizabeth’s house and we were in this small, tiny little kitchen that led out into this grand foyer with this staircase and everything. And it was pouring down rain outside. And I think it was Elizabeth’s cousin or brother-in-law – some relative of hers that was kind of a young man in his . And he was telling me about how he likes to play the trumpet. And I guess it was Thomas, because Thomas plays the trumpet. And he was saying how a keyboard is such a great thing because you can make it make all kinds of different sounds. And if you don’t really play a certain instrument, but you want it in your song, you can make it make that sound if it’s the right kind of synthesizer. And by this time I was like swinging on a swing, hanging from one of these stairwell things, and I think Mom comes in from the pouring rain and we go in that small little kitchen, and Elizabeth’s asking about a mini disc. She thinks she wants to have something in the mini disc format. And so I told her I would show her my recorder from WM&F and then I woke up."
373," Last night I had kind of a bizarre dream. I dreamt that I was at Elizabeth’s house and we were having a big party, and we were trying to cram all these people into this small little house. And there was like this carport thing in the front, and there was this blonde lady that was about  who was trying to tell me how to set up the sound system and what to do. And I don’t remember if I set it up or not, and I don’t even remember what she was telling me, but I do remember going in the bathroom and seeing this huge like garbage disposal like type thing. And people would throw their garbage in it, they would throw their dirty laundry in it, and there was a little toilet on top. People would even go to the bathroom in it. And they would like flush this _____ handle that would be like flushing a toilet. And for some reason I had the notion that it was getting plugged up and stuff and we were going to have to take some of the dirty laundry out of there. That was cuckoo, man! "
374,"Ok i remember just one part of this dream. We are leaving to go somewhere and we are in the car. I do not remember who i was with but get the feeling it was my family. As we come to this bridge which looks like it has a toll i remember i forgot something at home. So we have to turn around. Here is the wild part. I am sitting in the car looking ahead and the bridge goes STRAIGHT up to the point where it is SO steep it looks like a rollercoaster hill. i see cars going up it though, although in real life there is no way cars could get up this steep hill. we drive up this huge hill and i am freaking out thinking we are going to fall, we get to the first toll and turn around. well now we have to go over the huge hill yet again. This time its not like a hill but its like a draw bridge where part of the road is lifted straight up. So we ride up but are going too slow so reverse back down. Then we pick up speed and ride up it again when we get to the top we have to go over about a  foot section before coming back down the other side. I dont know how we made it but we did. Thats all i remember. It was freaky."
375," Last night I dreamt that we were with Elizabeth’s family again, and we were staying in a house. It was probably Tyler and Amber from Colorado, but it was this fairly big house. It was modern-looking and there was this room with this huge king-sized bed. And get this – this is so weird! Talisse and Josh and Arlene and Mike – those two couples – and Charmane and David wanted to do it all in the same bed. And there was enough room because it was this huge king-sized bed. And there was this young girl about  or , maybe , Deanne her name was, and she’s like, “Come lay down with me, Jessie, come lay down with me,” and I was real, real hesitant because I didn’t want to get in the middle of all that stuff going all over everywhere. And she had her back to all of them and I laid down with her, and next thing I know I went to sleep and then I woke up. And during that, they were all like sharing things and sharing pads and sharing condoms and stuff. It was like going to a public bath and watching everybody bathe, but this was going to a public bed. "
376,"ok this dream is sporatic as far as how i recall it. i waited too long to write it down so its probalby not going to be in order of how it happened. ok one part i am in some hotel i think... actually i think its more like a high rise building and i live there. there is some concert at a college that was rescheduled to replace the ozzfest. I see a poster on the wall of the college saying that System of a Down will be there. i know i still have tickets and want to go. As i am looking at the poster i see this long line of kids signing this paper in order to get into the show. I wasnt too worried cuz i knew my ticket secured me a spot. So i had to get to my place to find the tickets. i get in this elevator and this black guy in a wheel chair rolls in. The only floors to choose from are L,  and . I need to get off on , so i hit  and we both get off there. So I get off on  and i am outside. I see them doing some construction and i see an exit sign knowing i can walk down to the  floor from there. I see this guy up at the top of the hill motioning me over to where the door to the stairs are. well then i have trouble getting up this hill, i can't get up it to save my life. Somehow i must have gotten up and then i am in my apartment. i am looking everywhere for the tickets and can't seem to find them. I find an old pair but it wasnt the right ones. Finally i find the tickets. Then comes the trouble of trying to find something to wear. I always have problems with this in dreams. After trying on lotsa stuff i beleive i found an outfit i liked. I do remember actually making it into the concert at some point in the dream but dont remember much about it."
377," Last night I had a dream that I was in school and there was this project that students could work on. It was like basically an aquarium with the Little Mermaid stuff in it, and it had to get permission to be out of class for like two days a week for the rest of the semester to work on it. And I dreamt that I got it online and I got two of the raw materials to do it. I got the stand and the top, and the aquarium itself was going to be in a teapot and I got that. And I set it on the counter ready to go, and I, all of a sudden I was in this reception hall with my system, Peavey system set up and I was adjusting the faders so somebody could talk on the microphone as they wished and it wouldn’t feed back. And I couldn’t remember who was talking on it or what they said, but they were walking around pretty good and I was real nervous they were going to go over too close to the speakers and make it feed back, and then I would be blamed for it. And I do remember there was a guy next to me which I was adjusting the equalizer, well, while the person was talking on the microphone I started a Kenny D CD playing, and the EQ just sounded terrible, so I was sitting there adjusting it. And I was telling this guy that was sitting there that I keep my hand on the microphone fader so that if it starts to feed, I can just bring it down immediately. And I remember then we were starting to pack it up, and for some reason I realized I was naked. And I was putting all the stuff back in the boxes. I only put one of the speakers on top of the Peavey box and Dad was already hauling it out to the truck and there was another stand standing freely. Then I don’t remember what happened, and then I woke up."
378,"One part of this dream i remember i had this lion, it was a female lion and kinda small maybe the size of about a german shepard. Anyway we had to put her somewhere where she wouldn't be able to get out and attack people. So I stuck her in this fenced in area but the fence was only about  feet high and she kept jumping up onto the top of the fence and I would push her back inside and say NO! Then I realized I was going to have to build something higher. I remember being slightly nervous around the lion but she did not appear to be overly threatening. That's the only part I remember."
379," I am driving a jeep in the country. The land is green and dotted with old wooden houses. I park near Doug C. and his friend. We begin talking. I hear chopper blades and look up. A Huey with red cross markings prepares to land close by. I say to Doug, “Oh God, it’s a Medevac.” Then I am in a bar crowded with soldiers. I recognize several men, though I mistake one man for someone else. I take a long swig from a bottle. I am crying. I want the men to see this. I want the man mistaken for someone else to see this."
380," Last night I dreamt that I had a sleepless night, but I really slept really well. I dreamt that I was listening to the clock radio some more and Mom was talking to me, and we checked it before I went to sleep. But I could not get it to shut off, and I was trying all kinds of different things like make sure the s______ function’s off, make sure the alarm’s off, make sure the switch is off. I could not get it to turn off. I had to like take it apart just to make it shut off so I could go to sleep, and then I was really frustrated. And then I remember I came down to the couch with Mom, where we had the system on, and Dad was there and he started talking to us and we were having like a family conference at : at night. And then she was going to the swing, and I was getting back to bed. And then I remember being at this reception hall – I’ve been having dreams about that lately. But, you know what it was? We were at my tech school taking a tour and we had this – it was Elizabeth, me, Mom and Angel, I think – we had this really funny elevator we had to keep going up and down. And we were in the lobby that looked like the reception hall where we had the wedding, and then we came down this funny elevator and we landed in the parking garage, supposedly go into another building. And we saw Mrs. Hammondacross the parking lot, which is the lady who gave me the four-year degree lecture several times. And we just waved and smiled, and she said, “Are you here seeing the school?” and I woke up before I could answer."
381,"OK I don't remember a whole lot about this dream. I do remember people and friends were coming down with some deadly disease and I didn't want to catch it. I remember at one point we were at the hospital because a friend of mine had been admitted and we started talking about whether or not we would want to continue to live if we were in a vegetative state. I of course said I wouldn't and then we began talking about how you can inform a hospital of your wishes and what forms you have to fill out. Then came the question of what if you were sent to a different hospital and they didn't have the forms how would they know. It was quite an interesting conversation, that's all I remember though."
382," Last night I had a dream that – I can’t remember anything that happened before this – I just remember that Dad and I were Bringing Music for some reason and we were walking around and actually, I was there by myself at first, and I was going towards the back. And they said, “Is there anybody here to accompany you?” because I still looked like a little kid running around. And I said, “They’ll be here shortly.” And we were working and then I found Dad in the back somewhere and we were looking around, and we came to the back where this, it was kind of in this little booth on this little platform, but we were sitting at the edge of it. This lady had a cello and she was showing it to us. And I can’t remember why, but something came up about a G, and I was, I immediately sang a G, thinking that I knew it, and I was like, “This is a G; let’s see if I’m right.” And then she played a G on her cello and it was like two or three steps below, and she was, “Sorry, but you weren’t right.” And I was like, “Well, I guess I wasn’t.” And I can’t remember anything more. I wish I could though."
383," Today I dreamt that I was running around at Bancroft with some kids, and it was like after hours and we were kind of like playing hide and seek in a dark room and running around through different doors and stuff. And I remember Mom and I wanted to get out of there soon, but I think she was talking to somebody while we were running around. And then when we finally did get out of there, we went to these people’s wedding, and I was so mad because we didn’t get there to catch the beginning of the wedding. We got there like after the ceremony was over. And I can’t even remember who it was, but I had the notion that I was one of the bridesmaids for some odd reason. Then were at my high school and I was asking Elizabeth how I went with Mrs. Dougherty because she had talked to her the day before, and she just said that she wanted Elizabeth to help her collect notebooks and things. And that’s that."
384,Oh god i had another bug dream. i have these from time to time. I really hate bugs! In this dream there were bugs in my condo... I remember seeing this BIG ass spider in my room  I was trying to kill him but as usual in my dreams i couldn't. he kept getting away. then all these other bugs kept appearing it was really stressing me out in the dream. Very creepy looking bugs and they were all BIG!!!! ACK!!!!
385," Last night I had kind of a dumb dream. I dreamt that we were at Fort Washington and Mom was saying last time we were here we had a big fight. And I was swimming around and it was getting gray, and I came back to them and they said there is distressing news in the air, there is distressing news. And, of course, I thought that my distress was finally known to them. And it was really that there was a storm coming, and so because there was a storm coming, we headed home. And I had the notion that we were driving Grandpa and Carl and Arlene in our car, which we went to lunch with them yesterday, so that’s probably it. But we only drove Grandpa. And we dropped Grandpa off at his house, but then we brought Carl and Arlene home. I ran in and we had this porch that wasn’t screened in, and it was like one of those laundry room porch things that had all kinds of junk on it and I had the notion that my room was on this porch. My bed was there, a bunch of my stuff was there, I had a dresser there, and on top of that dresser the keyboard was still sitting on top of that dresser. And I had a mixer of the same design, with the same red faders, and kind of funky LED display and kind of funky design. I had a mixer the exact design, and they like went together like a set, and they were both sitting on top of my dresser. And I knew that Carl and Arlene were going to come in, so I put a towel over them so they wouldn’t see them. And I don’t remember too much more. Let me think a minute. And, oh yeah, in my dream they both worked, but before Carl and Arlene were supposed to come in, for some reason I ran in the house. The system was on to sound like people were home. I ran in the house and turned it up a little and then I came back outside to see Carl and Arlene. And it was like you could hear it out there. It was like I ran in and turned it on. I don’t know how meaningful that is, but it certainly is interesting. "
386," Last night I had a dream, really kind of weird dream. I dreamt that we were watching this movie in the living room on the TV. It was about these fish and how they act, and how they kind of like babysit each other and stuff. And that’s all I remember about that, and then some thunder woke me up. But then, when I went back to sleep, I dreamt that I was looking at these clocks because I was doing something before and I can’t remember what I was doing. I sat here and thought about it a little and I can’t remember. So I was looking at several clocks and I realized that neither one of them was giving me the right time. They had crazy whacko things. And then I woke up when my alarm woke me up, and I realized what time it was."
387," Last night I dreamt that my friend Cathy and I from freshman year skipped  period and she drove me over to some, she drove me over to Roanoke’s, the health food store, and we got spinach rolls and spaghetti and meatballs and we took the food to the park. And we sat on a bench and we were talking and talking about all kinds of different stuff. And we were talking until like : pm that night, and then she took me home. And I had no idea what time it was, and Mom and Dad weren’t really mad or anything, but they were wondering why would I be out so long with somebody and not call them and let them know. And I guess that was all."
388," I dreamt that Mom and Dad were getting ready to take a trip and that for some reason they were going to go to a nearby city’s Airport and fly to our local Airport, which seemed really, really strange because they could just drive to the Airport. And so when they were in the parking garage, everybody was oohing and ahhhing over their car and stuff, like they always do, and for some reason we had all of my equipment set up outside, and I had to bring it inside because it was going to rain. And I just took it one piece at a time and started bringing it inside, but I didn’t get too far because Mrs. Dubois came over and said she was going out of town. And her daughter wondered if I wanted some Halloween things that she had. And then I woke up."
389," Finally over with this crazy month. Last night I dreamt that we were at Ginnie Springs and that we were getting ready to go swimming. And we were at the springs and I realized that I was still fully dressed and I forgot my bathing suit. So I like went back to the camp site, or I thought I was going back to the camp site to get it, but I couldn’t find my way back and I came back several times to ask for directions. And then I finally realized that my time’s getting short and it’s really not important whether or not I had my bathing suit. So I ripped off my clothes and went in skinny dipping. And that would have been just fine if there weren’t three or four rappy boys standing around with a personal CD player and stuff. But in my dream I didn’t care, and just jumped in. And then I think I swam around for a little while. It was pretty shallow. And then we got out of the water and we went, we got back in the car, and then I think the kids suddenly appeared. They weren’t there before, but they like suddenly appeared. And we were going to some hotel, and I was thinking how, what a shame it was that the radio got shut off and there was a really good song on. And then I had the notion that I was looking at Sound and Vision in the back seat of the car. And then I remember, as I was slowly fading into consciousness, that I had the notion that the radio on my nightstand was on and it was playing the same song. And that I didn’t need to worry about it being shut off in the car. But when I actually woke up and regained full consciousness, of course, it wasn’t on. It wasn’t like the alarm was on and it turned on or anything. It was just in my dream, I thought it was. Well, I don’t know, that was an okay dream. I keep having dreams about Ginnie Springs; I wonder what that could mean."
390," I had this dream, and it’s : in the morning, and now I am wide awake. But, oh well, this dream is quite interesting and encompasses a lot of different things. First I dreamt that I was in the bedroom and I was trying to set up a two-channel stereo system. Or no, I was trying to fix the speaker connection because they’d come undone. So I shut off the receiver and unplugged it just to be safe. And I was making the connections with the binding posts – you know how that goes – and I dreamt that in my dream we had a sub in the bedroom, which we don’t. And that seemed to be alright; I didn’t have to do anything like that. So I fixed the connections and then I turned the receiver back on and I was putting the speaker back in place, and the wires came undone. And I was real afraid to touch them because, of course, when the receiver’s on they’re carrying power and I knew not to touch them or I’d be shocked. And then I dreamt that Dad was baking a mixer cake. By the way, this dream is going to probably take up the whole of this tape. I dreamt that Dad was baking a mixer cake and it was really cool, and he was kind of joking, like he is, about “Don’t let Mom get all the cake,” and stuff, and we were deciding on sizes for the cake by how many faders we have because we were cutting the cake with lines and we were cutting it according to, like we would say, “I want four of these channel strips, so I want two of the shell  strips,” and that would be how we’d know what sizes of the cake we want. Then I dreamt that I was writing these notes about how my life is being changed over the years, and I was writing these notes so that I could write this essay. And I was writing about the different phases that I went through, like first it was the toddler stage and then my animal magic show stage was -, and I said that I had went through a real shy phase when I was little, which I really didn’t, but in my dream I thought I had. And in all of this Dad asked about the music major, and, of course, I hadn’t said anything, I haven’t said anything to him about it. So I just kind of said, like I just kind of like beat around the bush, I guess. And he asked about it more directly again, and I was kind of stunned. Well, actually, I wasn’t really too, too stunned yet, and I just said, “Oh, we found it like  years later and it needed work,” or something like that. I then I stepped away to do something and he’s baking another cake. Or I think then I come home from shopping with Mom, and there it is, sitting on the table, and all the flour and all the mess. And it’s like sitting there in all its glory, and I’m like stunned. But the thing of it is, Dad thinks he can connect the mixer cake to it. And it was hilarious because it’s not even a real mixer he’s trying to connect to it. And I know for a fact that it didn’t have any a______ or audio out, but I was able to mike it and record it through my mixer. Here he is, trying to connect a mixer cake to it. And I’m like, he’s having Mom and I help him like move stuff, and I’m like grabbing Mom’s wrist and like doing the intermittent grip signal, like, “Oh my gosh, what in the world is happening here?” And I hated to see it in all the flour and all the mess, but everybody was trying to connect it to a real mixer. Oooohhhhhh! But, and then, I had one more part to this dream. I guess you could see why I’m wide awake! Then we were in Cash and Carry and we were looking at Easter bunnies, and over in the Easter Department we were looking at Easter bunnies and I was dancing to this disco music under this strobe light. I guess I meant what I said in my song when I said, “When I run through the pastures of my slumber, you’re never out of sight.” I feel I need to add to this that I didn’t really feel was important, but now I see it could have some meaning. I dreamt that I was wearing a tee-shirt with a picture of it on it, almost like the tree bird shirt, only it wasn’t. It was the color of the tree bird shirt and it had a picture of it on it, only I was walking through Cash and Carry. And I think maybe this could mean that some day – how should I say it – I think that I mean to say that some day I’ll be brave enough and confident enough to tell the world its story and wear it openly on my heart instead of hidden the way it is now. And I don’t know – I just , I’ve just still got this shy thing going on, I don’t know."
391,"ok i remember a couple small pieces of this dream. We are at some hotel  and we are walking around the city and I come upon a PINK squirrel sitting on the ledge. For some reason I believe i need to pick him up, so i do. He is a big squirrel too probably the size of a baby. Then we are at this hotel and the bus is leaving so we hop on it pulls away with only like / the people on board, it goes around the block and parks, so i get out and run back in the hotel to tell everyone where the bus went. They were people from my old job. That's all I remember. The pink squirrel really stood out, he was really bright pink kinda fuscia."
392," The only thing I really remember about my dream last night is that we were at this festival thing where we were getting ready to see this concert show. These girls were going to come out on a big stage and start singing. It was like in a big open space; there were no seats or anything. And so Dad and I were getting ready to get a really good spot. And he takes me and he puts me up on the stage where I can talk to the girls, and they’re like sitting there setting up their instruments. They’re like high school age. And I talked to them like, “Hey, how you doing?” and stuff. And then we come back to this boardwalk and we were standing out on the boardwalk just looking at stars and stuff, and that’s all I remember."
393,"I don't remember a ton of this dream I do remember I hurt my wrist in the dream and then it was throbbing in pain. I would feel the pain quite vividly. I was telling my friends I thought it was broken. Then I remember another portion where I got in my car and I drove out into the street and another car was driving down the street and couldn't stop. I remember looking up at the driver in that car and he just looked at me and shrugged as if there was nothing he could do, as if we would have time for all that. And then he hit me but not too hard, right on the drivers side. That's all I remember other then waking up and realizing I had twisted my wrist all up and it was throbbing in pain and asleep. So basically the pain incorporated it's way into my dream. Fun Fun!"
394," You know what, guys? This is a horrible tape, and I should know never to use it again. It’s getting old and it goes, “Squeeeeeeeeeeeeeeak!” And it’s got these little breaking up on the cell phone type of sounds when you play it back, so I’m never using this horrible tape ever again. Let’s have a go. For a simple mono voice track, one voice up close that doesn’t really record a whole lot, yes I will use this horrible tape. And some – I don’t know – I used to think it was years, but now it’s like a couple of months down the road I might be able to rip all my dreams to  files and put four or five tapes on one disc, because I don’t have to worry about the big long explanation, I’ll explain it later. Space is of a premium here. I had quite a dream last night. I dreamt that Mrs. Dougherty and I were in the little theater and first we were just standing and talking, and then we were sitting down in chairs next to each other. And next I was sitting on her lap, like Mom and I sit sometimes when she says, “You big baby.” And we were talking about like how the altos have the tendency to want to be more riled up and more street-like than the sopranos do. And then we were in the auditorium, and I was standing up on the stage and watching all of them coming up on the stage, and it was real clear this morning – the rest of it. But the tape rain out and I didn’t have enough room and I was going to do it on another tape but I didn’t have time in the morning; it was like : o’clock already. But now it’s all kind of like vague and foggy. I should have put it on first thing, as soon as I woke up. The bit I do remember is that we were supposed to, we were gearing up to go to this Sweet Adeline’s workshop and next thing I know, Dad and I are in the car and Mom’s riding her bike alongside, and then I woke up."
395," Last night I had kind of an odd dream, but it’s predictable. I dreamt that we were at this house with Grandma and Grandpa and Carl and Arlene and Lucy and Robert and Janice and Larry, and I think Jack and Polly were there too. It was like a family reunion. And, you know, I think they were all, I don’t remember Lucy and Robert or Arlene being there. But anyway, most of them were there. And I even think Ms. Fayne was there and Aunt Janice was in this blue dress. We were all sitting in the living room and this house had like a white tile concrete floor and it looked like a typical modern house. And I didn’t know whose house it was, but it was one of their houses. And whoever’s house it was, but there was this side room like a dining room almost, except there was no dining table. There was a keyboard in there too, and we were all sitting out in the main room talking, and there was this dog that was running around. And then we decided we would all move into the side room for some reason and the keyboard was by this time kind of in the way, kind of half blocking the doorway and they were kind of worried that I was going to knock it over. But, of course, I just kind of stood there and like stared for a minute at it, and Mr. Fayne told me not to touch it because she had no idea what it was going to do or sound like. So we all sat down on this little couch thing and we started talking. There were chairs and a couch in this room, and we like resumed our conversation. And Aunt Janice goes over and turns this thing on and starts “practicing,” except there’s only one problem – it doesn’t work really, and she’s like practicing away and moving her fingers all around, but there’s no sound. There’s only a tap, tap, tap, tap. And it’s like, what in the world? I guess we know where that came from. And then I woke up and I went back to sleep and I dreamt, I kind of like resumed the dream. I dreamt that we were still in the same house and that I had to get Mom’s boom box out of the attic. This house was like some modern house downstairs, but it was our upstairs. So I got Mom’s boom box out of the attic, and somehow I had the notion that the people’s keyboard wouldn’t work because the record key on Mom’s boom box was broken off. So I was like trying to fix it, but I think “record” and “play” were like attached together somehow and I was trying to figure how to attach it back on so that I could record somebody saying something with the boom box. And I attached it the wrong way first, so I had to like take it off and reattach it. And, you know, that’s all I remember at this time. What a shame! I should have done this when I first woke up. Oh well."
396," Last night I had a bizarre dream. I dreamt that I was coming home from staying at Las____ and that I was like on a flight, and when I got off the flight I was at the Washington Dulles Airport, just like I was. And Mom and Dad were there to pick me up at the Washington Dulles Airport, and they told me that they had moved our house into Washington, DC for the time that I was on the trip, so that I wouldn’t have to fly from Washington, DC to my hometown. And that was really bizarre, and I had the notion that our house had like shrunk or something. And anyway, I realized it was the same-sized house, but I could not fathom why they would move it into Washington, DC when I was on the trip. I also dreamt that we were watching this mermaid movie that had this different story to it. It’s all the basic same thing except they say that they’re looking and looking all over everywhere, and it kind of takes a twist like Pocahontas because they think Eric kidnapped her and they see her and Eric really love each other and somebody yells that Eric’s trying to rape her. And she like, they’re all like running after him, trying to get him, and she stops them, actually similar to Pocahontas. And there were these like statues that were drawn on the back of the movie box. One was Triton holding one of the Mermaid’s sisters. Another one was Eric at the ship, and the other two I don’t remember. Hmmm."
397," Last night I dreamt that I was doing some editing work and I was just first playing the original CD of Celine Dion’s new album and listening to the song called “Prayer” and the first verse was there, and the key change in the third chorus was there. But the second verse was just altogether missing for some reason, and I couldn’t figure out why. And then I said, “Okay, that’s enough of this,” and I was closing out the Little Performer, but when I went to close out the whole thing, these windows kept popping up, and I really couldn’t, and it was like a maze trying to get out of it. And then there was something that went wrong, and just about in the middle of all that mess I woke up. Phew!"
398," Last night I dreamt that some people from the hotel across the street wanted to set our house on fire. So they came in and they put little candles all in the living room without any candle holders, and they were going to like lead to a candle burn down and stuff. And I went, Sandra was in town and a lot of times I would lay next to Sandra the way I lay next to Mom. And I don’t remember too much else. I remember there was a really scary part about them telling us what they wanted to do, but I don’t remember it. And then I remember that after we put the candles out, I went down and I locked the front door. And then I went to come upstairs and look for Sandra, and I told her I didn’t really feel safe until I locked the front door. Then I dreamt that I was setting up my equipment at the picnic table and I had THE Peavey mixer, I had the amplifier and the CD writer and stuff, and I was setting up the wireless microphone. But I couldn’t find the right connection for the receiver and the X  alarm wouldn’t go in right, and I turned it on and I had the fader all the way down, but I turned it on and it made the loudest squeal of feedback I’ve ever heard in my life. And I dreamt that I was trying to connect these two quarter-inch connectors to the board, but they were all dirty and acidy and stuff, and I was wishing I had some of that spray that O’Brien had, because I think I had dropped them in the dirt or something like that. And shortly thereafter I woke up."
399," I just woke up from a dream I was having and I have a real clear recollection of it. I dreamt that we were at Tyme Gardens; well, no. I dreamt that we were at a carnival thing like in somebody’s parking lot, like and it was almost dusk and we were riding these rides. There were only a few of them. I can’t remember exactly what they did, but I remember we were riding some rides and it’s too many in my dream, and it was really, really fun. And then we were at home and for some reason Dad had some errands to do or something, so he was hanging like that in the truck and would drive away for like half hour to an hour increments, I don’t know, something like that. And I was setting up to jam in my studio. Of course the task ____ board is on my desk now, but here’s, Mom gave me this fresh set of batteries from somewhere and they were fresh and there was no ones in her boom box. And the next, oh boy, this is getting just all fragmented, isn’t it? Mom was fixing supper and it was going to be on any minute, but I had to do it, so I put this sign on my door, “Do not enter, surprise things.” And I tested out the keyboard again with the fresh set of batteries Mom gave me, and lo and behold, it worked beautifully. And I set it up on the stool, the black stool, since my desk was taken over by the task ____ board, and I don’t remember too much of what my session was like, but I do remember feeling really, really good that it was resurrected again. Of course, when I woke up, I realized it was only a dream, and I was like, “Oh man!” But this is one of these dreams that really gives you a good feeling when you wake up, just all around. The rides were fun, everything was fun, and it feels like  “______ in the song I sing today . You’re in my dreams at night, and when I rise, there’s a ______ of my slumber. You’re never out of thought.” The best I could sing at : in the morning. "
400," It’s about : this morning, and I was having a lot of little tiny like fragmented funny dreams. The thing of it was, was Dad came up to open doors and windows and woke me up at that hour, and then it took me half an hour to get back to sleep, and when I did, I dreamt that I was in my bed and Mom was bringing up the personal CD player, and she had me listen to a Mick Jagger song, and she was telling me about something – I forgot what. And then I sort of dreamt that I was seeing red and signs with red writing and I was hearing the first two notes of “Blue Bird” repeated over and over and over, kind of at a fast tempo. And I was seeing all this red, and It was really scary. And I was sort of somewhat conscious to know that I was in my room, but I was seeing all this red. And then next thing I know I hear Dad’s voice, and he said, well first, then I dreamt that the radio was on and it was playing this song from .. Again I was conscious that I was in my room. And I heard, there was this one jazz song called “Turn Off the Light” and Dad was there and he was saying, “When you hear this song, sing lilacs and lilacs, because if you sing, “Turn Off the Light” at night, it’ll make you think of dark and you’ll be scared. That was kind of, I don’t know, a little on the bizarre side. The other one was much sweeter."
401,"I only remember a portion of this dream. I am in this room, happens to be a bedroom with some other people we were waiting to go perform in some show or talent show. I was naked but it didn't seem to bother me, nor anyone else, it wasn't sexual or anything. Anyway I had some weed no me and this lady, who was some authority figure, walked into the room so I lifted up the mattress and hid the weed and my glass pipe under there. She was walking by everyone inspecting them. When she got to my end of the room she lifted up the mattress and found the contriband. I looked over and my mom was sitting on the floor against the wall, smiling at me cuz she knew it was mine, but she didn't say anything. The lady started to asking each person if it was their weed, everyone responded no. She got to me and I said it wasn't mine. Then she asked the guy behind me and he said it was his. I was wondering why he would get himself in trouble by saying it was his but i was quite thankful that he did. That's all I remember."
402," Last night I had a pretty crazy dream. I dreamt that there were these three or four older teenage boys that were kind of hanging around my house, and later I learned they were band members. And this one – I can’t remember if he was Sam or Justin or something – but whenever I would see him in the yard, he would always want to like pat me and shake me around, and not really beat me up, but pretend to. And then I would kind of elbow him off and pretend to punch him or something, and he would just, he would not give up, no matter what. He was a pretend fighter. And I was in the yard, and I didn’t want him to get me, so I went in the garage and I closed the door, and I was in there with the chickens for a while. And the next morning I was with him and all his friends and we were happy as can be. We were sitting around on the picnic table listening to some rap song on the garage outside system that we used to have. And we were like writing songs and stuff for this band, and I was like ready to play the drums on the picnic table. And I don’t know, but some time before that I was working in the kitchen and I lost my thumb, my left thumb got just sliced off by a knife, and it didn’t hurt me too bad or anything. I was just going around without a thumb, without a left thumb. And they called me the thumbless tin smith . That was pretty cool, I thought."
403,"Ok this dream was nuts and very vivid, probably because I was sick. I woke up Wednesday morning about  and then went back to bed. Once in awhile I can catch myself falling asleep  this happened a couple times as I drifted off and I remember telling myself ""stay aware stay aware"" but I must have been too tired and just drifted into sleep. Anyway on with the dream. There is a knock at my door. I live in a secure building so it's not like someone can just come knock on the door. None the less I went to answer it and there were a few people outside my door. One was some girl, I had never seen before, saying that I had stolen something from her beauty supply store, and that I had used a boat to get there. She said she knew it was me because of how much I weighed. WTF? Anyway I was like NO I didn't steal shit I don't know what the fuck you're talking about. They wanted to come in but I said no. I told them I would come out shortly. I went and got dressed and went outside. Now the outside looked NOTHING like where I live. I went downstairs and there were all these people talking it was as if they were going door to door trying to find the theif, which I found odd since she was so SURE that it was me. There was one point where I was walking down the street, it was sunny out and I could feel the sun on my skin. Everything looked SO real and SO clear. I couldn't beleive what was happening. I ran into my friend Shari from work and was telling her what was going on. Then I said, ""God I must be dreaming this can't be real"" and went on to PINCH myself to see if I was actually dreaming. I do not remember feeling ANY pain from the pinch in the dream, yet it didn't alert me to the fact that I was actually dreaming, so I didn't become lucid. Suddenly Shari had disappeared, another clear sign I was dreaming but I didn't catch on. Then I hear some Drill Sergeant yelling at people making them get in line and exercise. I was LIKE FUCK THIS! And I slipped around the back and went back up to my apartment. Then someone is knocking on my door again. I open it and it's one of the drill sergeants. He said something like ""Is Michael So and So here"". I was like ""No he doesn't live here"". They didn't seem to believe me and wanted to come in to check. I think I said ""Not without a search warrant"", or something like that  and I shut the door. Hell if i was letting them in my house. That's all I really remember."
404," Last night I had kind of a whacky dream. I dreamt that we were going camping and we were in the car and we were going all around these different trails and stuff. And then Mom and Dad were going to get out and scout around for a little while, so they left the ignition on; and, I mean, they shut the engine but they left the radio on that is with the ignition. And so they went out scouting around. Well, for some reason the seat came out of the car and was like rolling along on the road, and it turned into like a swing, and I would be able to like fly along the road because of it. And Mom came by and said that at somebody’s campsite they had a sound booth, and they were going to play songs on the sound system pretty soon. And I heard a song played and Mom was going to take me over to see the sound booth, but I don’t know, something happened. And then Mom came into the room and kind of woke me up. And then I went back to sleep and had another dream, that, well, maybe this was like a continuation of that one, I don’t know. I was at Sunset Grill with my equipment, and instead of Suzy Barton being there, there were these three or four boys that were kind of rough. And I had the Peavey system set up and I had the CD writer set up. I was going to burn some CD’s. And I was up on the stage and in back of the stage there was this wall where I had a few shelves where I put some equipment. And the boys were on stage announcing and I was sitting back there with my, I was facing the wall, facing the equipment. And I turned on my microphone and it made feedback, and somehow I had the notion that it was because I had two CD writers – one was mine that I use and one was this white one. And I dreamt that this white one had faulty circuitry, and it was letting signals through that were causing feedback. Now how whacked out is that! Oh, and the plot thickens! So I gave that white CD writer to the boys, and in exchange they gave me this personal CD/ tape player and they gave me a Spice Girl’s tape . And so we got home and Dad and I are working on DP, and this personal CD tape player is kind of unique in that it’s like an interface with DP. That’s bizarre! Well, I guess not really; it was like, it wasn’t really too bizarre, I guess. And we were playing the Spice Girls tape and I wanted to put it on an audio CD, and we were running it through DP to kind of clean it up some. And then in the middle of that I faded into consciousness, like I drew a cross ______. "
405," Last night I had a dream that I was getting ready for Sandra’s wedding again, and I was picking out my dress and my shoes and all that stuff. And I was also picking out an outfit to go out to dinner with Gram and Grandpa afterwards, and it was all out on the picnic table. And Sheryl, Sandra and Sam were around, and so then Sandra needed to go back somewhere and get ready, and Sam and one of his friends started riding around on their little mopeds. And next thing I knew I was sitting with this girl just talking and doing a little bit of studying on the picnic table, and, oh yeah – then I just totally forgot about Sandra’s wedding until Sam rides up on his moped and I said, “You’re just riding around on your old moped while she’s getting ready.” And there was this slide over this, that went over the back fence and right into the duck pool and so his friends rode his moped down the slide and then jumped off of it and landed in the pool. And I never gave the _______ away."
406," Last night I had a dream that this guy and his -year-old daughter and I were going to do the sound for a play at the local Performing Arts Center or some big venue like that. And so they came over to see what kind of equipment I had, and I thought they were going to look at the CD writer, the mixer, the amplifier – stuff like that. But instead they were looking at the digital performer program and how it’s set up. And so they did most of the work. They took the rig down and set it up over there in their little sound booth, which was more like a café-style box seat right over the stage, which there were a few spectators in, but there was mostly us. And I made sure I sat the closest to them so I could help them should anything go wrong. And we were all supposed to kind of help each other and do it, but the guy and his -year-old daughter did most of it, and I did more watching the play than helping them. And I was looking, from this box seat I could see everything that was going on on the stage, and I could see out into the seats, and I was thinking how Mom and Dad would be looking up at me in the assistant sound technician seat, but I really I did more watching the play than helping them. They didn’t really want me to help; they just wanted to use my equipment, so I sat there staring out into space and glancing down at the play every so often. I can’t remember anything more. I think when the play went out there was a whole lot of confusion and they just ran off with my equipment, intending to take it to house, I guess. I don’t know. And I just waited in that place and Mom and Dad came to get me. And then I woke up. "
407," Last night I had a long, rambling dream. I dreamt that we were standing in our front yard at kind of night time, and I was aware that we had our two chickens, our white one and our brown one. Well, coming out of I don’t know where, there was another white chicken, another brown chicken, a golden chicken, a goose and two baby chicks that seemed like they had finally come home after being like on the run for like a month or two and we had just forgotten about them and we didn’t know where they were. The only thing was the golden chicken was a mean old pecker. She would peck people. And I think the other white chicken was too. It was kind of hard to tell the difference between the old white and brown and the new white and brown. And then I dreamt that I had had a baby. I wasn’t sure if had a baby or a baby doll, but I was singing to it. Or I just remember sort of telling somebody that I was singing to a baby. I couldn’t remember if I was singing “Brahms Lullaby” or “La La Loo.” But then I was at school and I was in English class, but first I was waiting to get into English class and there was like this thing in the hallway that was like a steering wheel. It was green and it would say if you turn it, the alarm will sound. So I had to get away from that one. The college rep person was there and a few other students were there following me to English class because they needed to get there too. And there was like, I told them I’m usually very leery of red things because red represents seeing an alarm, but this time it was green for some reason. So we got into English class and we were kind of sitting there listening to this college rep guy advertising I think he was talking about USC and how great it is and how great their scholarships are, and, “If you drop out, we’ll hold your scholarship for ten years and if you come back, we’ll still give it back to you.” And I was r_____ there and I was looking through this book he gave me, and while I was – well, this is the funny part – while I was sitting there looking at this book of scholarship stuff, I started to get a little nervous and a little afraid because I was thinking of the song I was singing to the baby and I was also thinking about how we were calling ourselves Mamaloo, Papaloo, Babyloo, Chickenloo and Roosterloo. It was all kind of funny. And then I started fading into consciousness and I was thinking of those things, and I realized I was laying on my back with my arms above my head, and then I woke up."
408," Last night I had a dream that we were on a boat, and while we were going to this boat show, we were walking along the dock. And we met this guy who had a boat who was really, really friendly. He ended up taking us on his boat because he was impressed with all I knew about sound and stuff, but I don’t remember too much about that. But I remember that I got out and I start swimming and there was another boat close by and it was just sort of anchored out. And then I couldn’t really help it, I was right at the stern and something just cut my leg like crazy, I think how the propeller does. It wasn’t stinging, but the edges were real sharp like a knife, and it just cut up my leg like crazy. But then when I came back into the guy’s boat all I had was one little scrape, so I don’t know what that was all about. The next thing I knew, we were on land and we were back at the house and trying to, Dad thought we had such a good time, he wanted this, we still had one in our dream, and he wanted to get ours insured and give it a name so that we could. And then I dreamt that we were at this place where . was sponsoring this “Friday, Thank God It’s Friday” party. And Mom and I were sitting on these restaurant booth benches, but there was no other side to them. There were these restaurant booth benches with a long table and out in front people would get out and dance and sing and just be real showy like. And there were some people sitting on booths and tables on the other side and a lot of people standing around the edges, and people would come up and dance and all. And everybody was cheering, “Friday, thank God it’s Friday!” And we were eating some kind of dessert thing, and next thing I know, what should appear in front of me but a keyboard that spanned like six or seven octaves. And it just like appeared in front of me! And Mom said she just laid it in front of me, and I asked her where did she procure it, and she didn’t answer me. And I didn’t really make a big row thing or anything. All I really could do was smile at her and nod my head, which I think she got the picture because she smiled at me too, I think. And I took her hand and I shook it a little. That’s all I really could do. And then next thing I knew, we were in this restaurant, which was adjacent to this party room-like place and it was still there, and we were finishing up and cleaning up some stuff and we were keeping an eye that it was still there. And then Mom went to the bathroom or something and it just disappeared into thin air, and Arlene returned in her place. And Arlene wanted to climb up to the top of this observatory tower with me, and so I started climbing, but I wasn’t really into it. We got about half way up and then we turned around. And then I saw myself on TV, and I heard something on the radio that I had the notion was my work, but I don’t know. Oh well, then I woke up."
409," Last night I had kind of a strange, odd dream. I dreamt that we were doing some major house remodeling and that the door jamb by the stairwell and the little arch above the hallway, we were going to need to set it on fire to make it straight, and I was thinking how it would set off both the smoke detectors and it would make us _________. But we cleaning out some stuff, like from Mom’s shed, and there was a whole basket of like stuffed animals and stuff from when I was little, and a couple of towels and a couple of little baskets and a couple buckets and, you know, little miscellaneous stuff. And most of it I went through and I said, “Okay, I want to throw this out and this out and this out. But then we came to some stuffed animals and things, and there was this one teddy bear that was really cool. He was sitting in a chair and the chair was covered with a towel. And the towel was like real pretty with like stars and seashells and glittery stuff on it. And I lifted the towel, and it was this talking, singing teddy bear, and he had a keyboard on his lap. And he would like sing songs and play it, and like do like little kids things and stuff. And so anyway, I really thought he was cool and I wanted to keep him for like when we were babysitting. But then when I went to cover him back up with the towel, so nobody would see him, the towel was totally missing. The towel was gone. And I couldn’t find it anywhere. It was like it was part of the chair, it was part of the thing. I told you, it was real fancy. And then, since I couldn’t find the towel, I sat him in this basket and covered him up with an ordinary towel. And I came in the house for a second – let me think for a minute – I think Dad had the TV on and there was one of those parades of things that I used to make when I was real little going around on the floor. And I can’t remember what I was doing or where I went or why I went in the house, but I was thinking, “I have to go out to the picnic table to where I was cleaning out and bring the teddy bear before somebody throws it out because it’s disguised as some other thing. So I can’t remember if I did or not. Then I woke up. That was strange, man."
410," Last night I dreamt that we were at Ginnie Springs and we were at a little campground site, and we were walking around these various different trails, and it was real peaceful. It was Mom and Dad and I, and we were supposed to like meet somebody somewhere, I think. And Mom was setting up a little campsite. She was setting up some cooking and some tea and stuff, and Dad and I were going to take this little roller coaster ride type thing, and so we did. We got in line and we sat down on this little two-person roller coaster thing; I was behind him. And we started going and I had forgotten to fasten my safety harness, and I was yelling, “Wait, wait, wait!” but it was too late. We were already up in the air, and we like went up in the air off the tracks, and my little seat detached from his and it turned into like a glider, and it would fly how I moved my body and so I kind of flew it with my body. And it was really, really cool. And then we got to this, we were flying across this body of water, this little lake, and we were coming to the dock and I was able to land my little thing right on the dock, which I thought was pretty cool. And so we walked down this little dock bridge path thingy until we got to the little campsite that Mom had set up, and she was like hanging out some wet clothes to dry and cooking up some tea and all. And then I had a second little dream that she had prepared this poster thing, and she had found three or four pictures of Sam with the music major and me like as a little toddler of three years old with a scared look on my face, and then a picture of a guy  itself and then a picture of me  years old near it with a big smile on my face. I don’t know why that keeps coming back to me in my dreams. That is just silly, silly, silly. "
411,"Ok I hit the snooze button and actually had a dream within the  minute period between the next alarm. Kind of surprising because most people don't start dreaming RIGHT when they fall asleep. Anyway I remember being at my moms house. I remember my brother was now living at home . He had not come home and I was really worried. When I got up that morning I peeked in his room and saw him lying on the bed. I remember feeling very relieved that he had decided to come back home. He must have heard us and he woke up. Some other girl was there, on the phone but I don't know who she was. I walked into his bedroom and he was making his bed. He had a dark DENIM bedspread he was pulling up. He seemed a little upset about something and I wanted to give him a hug. Then I woke up."
412," Last night I dreamt that I was setting up Halloween things, and I was, I had this one witch candle, and I had this like ghost thing that was a candle as well. And for some reason I was setting these things up in the garbage closet instead of on the porch and I also had my other little candles and stuff like that. And I was afraid that if we left the candles in there too long, they were going to start to melt down and set things on fire. And so I took them out, and I just took everything out for the time being. And then next thing I knew, we were up on the roof doing a play about some Halloween characters. We were like acting it out, and I was just like a spectator watching all of this. It was Mrs. Dougherty’s class I realized, and she was like sitting perched in a tree a few feet away watching us as well. This was in front of my room. Part of the roof in front of Mom’s room, we heard Al Jerot playing on a tape player and we heard people singing. And Mrs. Dougherty said, “Wait a second. My class is supposed to be up here.” And so she kind of got out of the tree and walked over there and saw that it was Mr. Girard’s class over there, which really this was switched around because our class should have been doing the singing and his class should have been doing the acting. So then she comes back from talking to him and says, “My class over here.” And she has us climb out onto the tree and down, and then we’re like running around our back yard, which is like four times bigger than it usually is. I think this is going to auto-reverse. I can’t believe this thing can’t even auto-reverse on its own any more. I have to help it along. But anyway, that was the basic point of that. Then we were just running around and playing around. Oh, I know, this group of girls said, “Jasmine is so good. She only talks to her boyfriend and to her mother.” And we were like holding hands and saying little crazy stuff like that. And that’s all."
413," Last night I had a really crazy dream that I was at the aquarium, and I was kind of going up and down in this elevator and we were walking along these hallways and there were fish tanks on either side. And I had the notion that they were going to serve us lunch and I had to get down there in time for lunch, but the elevator was doing some crazy stuff. And we stopped at one of these floors where they had this like little sitting area, and I dreamt that we were, then all of a sudden, juxtaposed, I was at home with the monitor reading this children’s book that was like a variation of Little Mermaid. I keep having dreams about the Little Mermaid having slightly different details to the story, like this time I dreamt that instead of Eric being saved from drowning, for some reason Ariel needed CPR, and in order to break Ursula’s spell, instead of kissing her, Eric had to give her two breaths of human breathing so Ariel could stay a human forever instead of a kid. Now that was rats, man! "
414," I am searching for NVA hidden in the stalls of public bathrooms. In a frenzy I kick doors open. The enemy wear green uniforms and have long black hair. They are silent and beaten and offer no defense. I am yelling as I shoot. I am screaming. I am shooting at close range. When the dead slump down, there is little blood. After the killing I shoot them again."
415," I had a pretty crazy dream last night. I dreamt that I was going to take the Peavey system to a party like in a courtyard, and Mom stopped at - and got a bottle of wine for us to drink, like we do coffee there sometimes. And then all of a sudden I was at home working on DP. I was editing a file that had some variation in it as to what was going on and what was going to happen at the party. And I didn’t really want Dad to hear it, so I kind of like tried to close it out real fast before it actually opened, and it got all screwed up. And then I woke up. Hmmm."
416," Last night I had a dream that Ms. S_____ and I were going to a pool party, and that they were swimming around and swimming around in the pool. I was kind of trying not to touch the bottom with my feet, thinking there was a pool cleaner roaming around, which a lot of time is what I do anyway. I try to grab the side because I don’t want to reach down and find anything buried down there. So then we got out and we were walking around the side and there was this kids’ slide that had stairs leading up to it, and then the person would like slide through the puddle and then out and down the slide. And there was this pail of plastic potato chips that really smelled real with a shovel and a couple other play things that kids could play with. And then I went inside this like club-like type place and the lady said that she does birthday parties and things, and I gave her my card and said, “Call me if you ever need a DJ.” And then I dreamt that I was home and Mom was telling me this big secret, that there was something that she had that was really secret and not to ever use it until her and Dad went out of town. But I don’t remember what it was, but it was something small and electronic like a camera or a cell phone, or maybe she was referring to the mini disc recorder, I don’t know. But then her and I were dancing around in the living room because we were so happy about something; I don’t remember what. And let’s see, and then when Mom and Dad came back from being out of town, Mom confided in me that the car had automatic horns, whatever that is! And that would mean that whenever somebody’s singing in the car and they hold a long chromate at the end, the horn will start honking after you’re through! That was crazy, man! "
417," Last night I had a dream that Mom and Dad went out for the evening and I had some things to do while they were out. First of all I was putting some CD’s in the CD player and I was going to dance and stuff like I usually do. Then I had this notion that I had to go out to get something; I don’t remember where it was or what I had to do, but I had to go somewhere. So I got in the car, I started it up and I sat in the back seat, and it just took off from there and it just sort of knew where I wanted to go. And it stopped and it parked itself in the parking lot when we got there. Like I said, I don’t remember what it was, but I remember getting out and talking to somebody in the parking lot and being real afraid because I don’t look like I’m of age to drive. Then by the time it was time for me to come home, it was dark and I was really afraid because I was going to crash somewhere. And again, I started it up and I sat in the big seat with this ____ thing, and it just sort of knew when to stop at this traffic light and knew where to turn – that was so crazy! But when we got to Allison’s, we were almost home and we were coming down  Street, and we were at Allison’s and it just sort of stopped in front of her house. And Megan came up to me and started asking questions, and I didn’t want to start it up and move it home because Megan was right there and she would think it’s funny. And so after talking to Megan, I just walked home and I put the boom box out on the front lawn and played some CD’s and I sat in the green chair. And then I woke up."
418," Last night I dreamt that I was typing up a research paper, and we were in the library and I was using a machine and there were like about five people in line to use it. So I closed out my document and I hopped down from my chair and decided to give somebody else a turn. And Ms. Forrest was there. And there I am waiting in line for all these people to get finished. And somehow I had the notion that I was interning at Safeway, and I was sitting there waiting around, and I don’t know, just kind of blah."
419,"ok i remember bits and pieces of this dream. First i remember my mom and her boyfriend Loy were in it. They were going to be going into space, in the space shuttle that evening and we were all talking about it. I had something I had to do that evening too, but I can't recall what it was. I also remember thinking about catching some concert when I was done, some female singer but don't recall who. I remember this one scene were I was standing in the street and these little girls were biking down the street as if they were in a race. There were all these people standing off to the side watching. They had gold sashes on that signified some kind of prize. I made a comment that they should get trophies. So while they are riding suddenly the sashes turn into trophies which they are holding as they ride. As they approach the finish line the trophies become even larger, so big that they normally wouldn't have been able to hold it. Then I remember going into someone's suite at a hotel I think and asking where the hot tub was. She said it was out on the balcony. I walked out there and some person was out there. I began telling them that my mom and her boyfriend were going into space. Then I went on to say that if for any reason the space ship exploded I would lose the only  people I had left in my life. Although I don't remember feeling sad or distraught when saying that, was just stating it as an interesting fact it seemed. That's all I remember."
420," Lately I’ve been having some epic dreams, but they escape me as soon as I wake up because I haven’t made it onto this tape. But tonight I remember a little bit of pieces of what I dreamt. And I dreamt that I had gone to this concert with Mrs. Dougherty and her class, and I had my mini disc recorder and I was recording it. And at the end the presenters asked for comments, and nobody but two people gave comments. And then when I was walking up to get the newspaper at  Avenue and  Street, I was still carrying the mini disc recorder and the straight lavaliere microphone in my other hand to get any kind of other sounds I could, and I saw Mrs. Dougherty at the corner there when I was getting the paper and she said, “No wonder no more people made comments. You had that thing!” Oh, I know, I left it like in the grass the next block away, and then I went up to see her and then she said that. And she ended up walking me home, and I never went back to go and get it. And then I woke up"
421," Last night I dreamt Dad was kind of in some kind of a snit, which he really is, and we were driving along, driving on a trip doing something. And there was like this smooth jazz concert going on in the park and we thought if we stopped and we laid down a picnic and all, that would be good. And so we stopped the car and we got out, and we went over, we started walking around and they, this guy was giving out big candy trunks, candy bar-like trunks in this box, and I took a big chocolate one. It was just kind of like the size of a rock. And I took a bit of it, and before I knew it, it turned into like a chocolate walking stick, so I was walking around with it. And then Dad thought that would be too dangerous, so he took it. And we walked around the park and we were listening to the songs, and Mom was kind of miffed because he didn’t sit down and pay attention to her. He was walking around and listening to the concert with me. And then I just remembered something else. Before all this, there was another part of the dream, that we were at my high school and Mrs. Dougherty was holding a Christmas concert in the little theater. And we were invited and her chorus was going to put it on. And I was thinking that I would finally hear something from her chorus. Well, it turned out that they weren’t ready and they didn’t put it on. That was kind of a bummer. And then I woke up."
422," Last night I had kind of an odd dream. I dreamt that Dad was doing some construction work or something for this neighbor of ours, and we were all going over to their house to have some kind of party. And we went down into this big, huge cellar where they were going to have the party, and it had a linoleum floor that was white and walls that were white. It wasn’t gray like cellars usually are. And it was all real fully lit and they had a sound system down there so people could dance and sing. And I remember dancing and taking the microphone and singing something, but I don’t remember what. And then I remember this boy got up there and did the same thing ______________. And we were all taking our turn and doing our things. And then I came up from the cellar to check on Dad and he was doing some construction work while we were all down there. And I could hear the little boy singing “Pointer’s Bay.” And I don’t remember what happened too much after that, but when I went back down, I had kind of missed the party, and the party was over. And the cellar, it wasn’t fully lit, but it had these little like spotlights – I guess they call them emergency lights – around, and a few candles that were lit. And it had some flashing lights on the railing like emergency vehicles have. And Mom took me down there and she was showing me how to turn on the other lights. See, what people did when they went down into the cellar, okay, so what a person would do when they’d go down in this cellar, is they would turn on the big lights before they turned off the small lights, because if they turned off the small lights first, they would be in total darkness. And I was trying to tell Mom – she like had me on her shoulder – I was trying to tell her to turn on the other lights before she showed me how to turn off the small lights, but she didn’t listen to me and we turned off the small lights and we were in total darkness. And then I woke up."
423," Last night I dreamt that I was setting up my sound equipment on a stage. Actually it was like on a stage out in our back yard. And I had the Peavey escort system and my CD player and I also had three inline signal processors, I had a raver  machine, I had an equalizer, and I had one other thing, I don’t remember what it was. And so I was setting all this stuff up, and I was setting up the microphone stand, and I was getting ready to do a show and talk to the people who were sitting out there. And I don’t remember what happened. Oh, I remember what happened. For some reason or another the microphone wouldn’t like start feeding back for some reason and I noticed that the gauge said it wouldn’t. And then I went over to the mixer and I notice that whenever I would bring it down to an appropriate level, when I would go over there and stand and talk, it would jump right back up, all the way up. And it would just keep doing that. ______ I’ll duct tape in place for you, but we had to turn the system off and unplug it first, and so the show got delayed, of course. And I don’t even remember if I ever did it or not. And then we were on the front porch and somebody dumped a whole basket full of kids' toys on the porch and I was picking them all up and I also had a little basket of sequins. And those three inline signal processors were like on a cart like you wheel around school, along with the big mixer. And I had the notion that I had received those as big presents for Christmas. And it was just, I was on the porch and I was talking to a whole bunch of people, and that’s what it was. And then I slowly faded into consciousness."
424,"Going to post these together since they happened the same night and had a common theme, although were completely different. : First dream I only remember a small part. I am at the airport with my brother  and some other person. We are flying back to Washington. We get to the gate to check in and on the board I don't see the flight for DCA. So I remember getting a bit stressed thinking the flight had been cancelled for something. Then the lady told us the flight was still taking off so we checked in. Then I remember her saying she was hungry or something, so my brother offered to go get some food. I was going to go with him but he took off ahead of me. I walk out into this section where there are corridors going off in like  different directions. I don't know which way he has gone so I just scream ""STEVE!!!!!!"". I wait and then scream ""STEVE!!!!!!"" again. FInally I hear him respond. I keep screaming his name until he finds me and then I wake up. Dream : I am with  girls and we are trying to get to the airport. I remember intially this one girl was driving and we were going down some windy road, then she remembered that she had forgotten something and we had to go back. Then suddenly I am driving and we are once again going down this windy road. Then suddenly the car falls off the road . So the car goes head first and we hit the pavement. I remember hitting my nose on the ground, as if there was no windshield on the car. It was also a very small car like a VW Bug or something. Everyone had fallen out of the car, one girl had a baby with her but it didn't get injured. We picked up the car  and set it up right and got back in. Then I am on my old street where my mom lives. I tell them I am going to run in to see if she can take us to the airport, we were short on time. She opens the door up and we had a very short conversation and she basically said she wouldn't drive us. I distinctly remember saying ""Well FUCK YOU then!"" and she replied ""FUCK YOU TOO"" and i walked off. LOL That's all I remember, we never did get to the airport though. I have had a lot of dreams over the years dealing with making it to the airport on time, or missing a flight etc, not sure why. I have never missed a flight before, although I have flown quite a bit  because my dad was a pilot of American Airlines. But in the last  years I have only flown about - times. Very odd."
425,"I honestly remember nothing about last nights dream except for this one scene. I am looking in the mirror and my hair, oh my god. It was black  and it was SUPER curly and just poofed all out all over my head. I was just staring at it like What the Fuck??? I didn't know how i was going to deal with my hair, there was just so much of it and it was very very nappy. LOL"
426," Last night I had a bizarre dream. Last night I dreamt that Talisse was getting really carried away with like pot and things, and she was like totally whacking out on me and totally not being my friend. I would have to be so careful when I would be in contact with her because I dreamt that because she would have like traces of it on her hands and she’d like shake my hand and try to get it on me, so that if she ever got searched and found that it would be proven that I was involved in it too. And get this – this is really bizarre – we were in this store, like a Marshall’s or a Service Merchandise, and there was this box that was of a teddy bear and what she did was she stuffed the teddy bear with it, and she put the teddy bear in the box and she wrapped the box like a Christmas present, and she put it in my shopping cart. And I was like so afraid and wanting to get away from her so bad, but there were these various wrapped presents in my shopping cart and I didn’t know which was the one. And oh, it was just totally bizarre. And that’s all I can remember."
427," Last night I had kind of a crazy dream that was a conglomeration of several things. I dreamt that I was swimming through this pool carrying this replica of King Triton’s trident, imagining and believing that I was going to take it back to his castle or something, or take it from him and give it to Ariel, or something like that. But I was like part of the story and we were acting it out in this swimming pool. And then all of a sudden it was juxtaposed with the fact that I was at school and that I was just starved. I hadn’t eaten in a few days. And two or three people that I know – they were like girls, I guess, I don’t know who they were – but they were supposed to give me lunch. And they got this big thing of pretzels, a big thing of chicken nuggets and a big cup of soda for all of us. And I had to go do some other errands before I could get there to get to them, but I was running through the school because when I’d go past the boys’ bathroom and the boys flush the toilet, it goes, “Flahhhhhhb,” kind of like a bathroom tub faucet or shower thing. And so they had flabbing toilets and flabbing sinks in the boys’ bathroom at school. So I had to run past that. Then I had to run through a really vulnerable area where the fire alarms would go off at any moment. And I finally got over to in front of the cafeteria where they waiting for me, and somehow I had the notion that a few feet away from us was the boys’ bathroom that had flabbing toilets and sinks. And they had a big thing of pretzels and a big thing of chicken nuggets and a big cup of coke, and I started eating a pretzel or two and the girls were all kind of getting silly and laughing and stuff. And I ate a chicken nugget, and I was going to take a drink of soda, but I spilled the whole darned thing, and I was so mad. And I was sure that they thought I was little blind gooch . And then the boys’ toilet went “Flahhhhb” and I got all nervous and spilled something else. And then all of a sudden that was juxtaposed with the fact that I was laying down in the living room while Mom and Dad were watching TV and I realized that I had fulfilled my duty in playing my part in the mermaid story at the swimming pool, and so that was that. And then I woke up."
428," Today was my dream was real whacked out. I dreamt that I was riding along in this wheelchair like type thing and I was like scooting along down a path supposedly to get to Fort Washington Beach. And I would like to sit in this wheelchair and like scooch along and ooch along and get going at a pretty good speed, and we would be going down brick roads, around and through sand spur trails and through, and across the sand and through water and all kinds of different stuff. And we were nearing Fort Washington Beach and Mom had to lift me over this really big log, and she lifted me up with my chair and all and she put me down on this, the next block that had a grate vent in it. And there was this big electrical box next to it, and the vent was letting out hot air and I was like, “Aaahhh, aahhhhh, aahhhhh,” because I was scared. And she was trying to explain something to me, but I didn’t really hear her. She was just trying to kind of, I don’t know. Then I dreamt that I was in our living room and we had a DVD player and we were trying to adjust the amplifier, and when we would change the sound field when the unit was on, there were like seven or eight – it was at the top of the unit that would change the sound field – and when we would change the sound field when the unit was on, it would cause this terrible, horrible grinding sound like you were shifting the gears in the car, or if you were trying to shift into park while it was still rolling – that kind of a sound. And so whenever we did that, we had to turn the unit off, change the sound field, and then turn it back on again. And I don’t remember exactly what, but something was screwy with the TV and the DVD player. They didn’t want to cooperate, but I think we were getting there. And then I woke up. And that’s all she wrote."
429," Last night I dreamt that Gloria Estrazon was coming to Straw Park for a concert, and that the concert started at : and that we were going to have to get there two hours early in order to get decent seats. And it was : and Mom kept diddling and diddling and diddling and diddling and diddling and we didn’t get out ‘til :. But when we got out, I learned that the plans had changed and it wasn’t Gloria Esteban, it was Bette Midler and she was coming to our yard. So we were setting up chairs and tables and stuff for people, and she was going to stand in the garage and sing. And then amongst all this I realized she is going to need some audio reinforcement. So we got out the Peavey system and Dad was going to play the drums. So he had his drums at his table and I had my mixer at my table, and we were ran the wires and I think we might a microphone by Dad’s drums and I ran them into the Peavey board. And, of course, hers. But hers was the far right like it was the master, her fader. And she started singing, and I had to just do it on the fly without a sound check, so I had to guess at the levels and then quickly readjust them as the concert started. And then, in amongst all of this, I realized that all of a sudden we were in an auditorium and I was singing kind of like on a side close to the stage, and I didn’t have a mixer, but I had my mini disc recorder and I was recording the whole thing. And she was singing the song, “Prayer” by Celine Dion and she was like swirling and spinning through the aisles and I got to see her. And then I dreamt that the lights came up in the auditorium and she was introducing that she was an ID vocal teacher at the school, and that she was going to let some of our ID students perform. And then I woke up. Oh, but no, not yet. I kind of woke up, and I took a look around and then I went back to sleep, and I dreamt that we were going shopping. And we were going down in the cellar of Safeway to see if they had any more cakes or something. And all of a sudden there was this, “bang, bong,” and I woke up, and it was the first note to the song that was playing. When it came on, it woke me up, so that was kind of strange."
430,"Ok some guy was in my dream. I remember kind of what he looked like. He had short brown hair, well groomed, he was kind of lean and tall. We were at my moms house I think, almost as if I lived there. We were laying down on the floor i think, maybe against some pillows or something. I had on a buttoned down shirt and he kept sticking his finger through my shirt and tickling me on the stomach and poking me. I was playing all coy. I do know that I felt attracted to him in the dream, but thats all I remember. I remember one other small tid bit. I was changing clothes and i looked down and there was a long scratch  that went from just below my neck all the way down to my stomach. In the dream I though my cat had scratched me, I remember looking at it but it didn't hurt."
431," Last night I had a dream that I was having a kind of blah day at school and that I was going to buy some lunch, but I didn’t really have any money, so I didn’t. Coming back from the cafeteria, I ran into a handful of people who said they were putting on like a secret thing for Double Vision but it was kind of obscene and absurd. And they were keeping it a secret from the librarian, but Elizabeth thought they should tell her and ask her if they could put it on. So she took them in, most of them, but two girls went with me up somewhere into a little area that had like bathroom and then like slides and a couple things. And I had to take my clothes off to take a shower and I just sat there on a swing like type thing just talking to these two girls. And we were concerned about people coming in and seeing me, so every time somebody would come near the door, I would duck, but anyway, that was that."
432,"Ok I remember a lot about this dream. The first part is a bit sketchy. I recall driving down to Florida with  friends. I remember that the trip only took us about  hours. Which in reality would put me in North Carolina not Florida. I don't remember a ton of specifics however. There was this one part where I saw this girl but I saw her from the perspective of The Sims game as if I was looking down on her and she was this little cartoon person. For some reason I wanted to say hi so I went and rang the door bell, now it was a normal perspective. She opened up and I walked in. Told her I just wanted to introduce myself so we talked for a bit. Next I think I had actually driven back and I was at my mom's house. It was Christmas and some people were going to be coming over. We were waiting on my asshole father  and some other man who I supposedly knew. My mom was getting the house ready and stuff, and preparing food, while I was just hanging out. I remember going outside and I walked to the end of the driveway. I was going to go across the and say hi to Mrs. Hadaway, but then it dawned on me that she had died a couple years ago . I could see Mr Hadaway and someone else through the window, but I stopped and went back into the house. I remember suddenly feeling guilty that I had no gift for my dad. Normally I wouldn't care but I guess in the dream I realized he wuold be bringing me a gift and I didn't want to have nothing for him. So my mom and I were looking around the house to see what I could give him. She had this wooden sculpture about  foot high and we agreed I would give him that. Then I recall noticing that it was about  and I realized that I had left all my Christmas gifts at home. I told my mom I needed to run home to get the gifts. There was a small gift of some type of jewelry for my mom, some HUGE black wooden sculpture of some animal for the un known guy, and of course the small sculpture for my dad was no longer at my mom's house it was at my house. So I told my mom I had to run to my house and to wait for me to get back that I should be back by . She seemed a little pissed about it. I walked out the door and my dad had just arrived. He was walking towards me and appeared drunk, I gave him a hug and told him I would be back. I hopped in my car and headed to my house. My car was acting really funny, it wouldn't break properly, so I kept running lights. Then suddenly I rear ended someone, and someone else rear ended me. We all pulled over. I saw the guy who hit me walk up and start talking to the other guy. So I pulled my car up closely and suddenly it's in this window of this little toll booth like room. The car had literally gone through the window. I reversed it a bit and got out. Then we all exchange information. The guy I hit gave me his card, I looked at it and read it and found whatever I read to be very interesting and even commented on it, but I can't remember what it said. Finally I am back on the road and I make it home. Then suddenly I am in Old Towne Alexandria with  other friends, Shari from work and someone else. Shari said we had to pick someone up, I was like, ""look I have to get back home"" and she went on to tell me where she would be. I said I would swing by but if she wasn't there I was going home. Then I remember being back at my mom's house and I woke up. I had another dream earlier that involved my mom and we were arguing about something. It was extremely stressful and I was very upset. I can't recall the arguement but I got so upset that I literally made a groan that was so loud I woke myself up. At which point I was releaved but I still felt quite stressed out about it all."
433,"Ok I definitely don't remember all of this dream but I will recall what I can. I remember my dad was in the dream, for some reason I think I was in california. He said he had bought me a truck and was going to give it to me. So we get ready to get in the elevator. I got in and for some reason no one else made it into the elevator. Before the door even closed the elevator went plunging to the bottom floor. It was going so fast that I was stuck to the ceiling of the elevator by the force. I remember feeling the sensation of falling. It slowed down when we reached the lobby and I landed on my feet and walked out. I remember seeing the manager there and telling her that the elevator was broken, see seemed frustrated that it was broken again. Suddenly my dad was there again and said he was going to go get the truck. So I waited outside for him, kind of in this alley but he never showed. So I walked back into the hotel and went out the front but still didn't see him anywhere. I don't remember how this part concluded but I think I finally found him. It was one of this BIG pick up trucks, looked brand new, and was maroon. For some reason, even though he was giving me this truck he wouldn't let me drive it, I wasn't sure why. Then I started to wonder how I would get the truck back from California to Virginia. I was thinking I could drive but it would take more than  days, so I wasn't sure what I was going to do. I went on to think about why would my dad just be giving me this truck? Something must be in it for him. At that point my dad and the truck were no longer in the dream. I remember talking to some lady and she told me that it was just some big conspiracy, with my dad trying to give me this truck. I don't remember the details though. Next I remember seeing this black man. He was using some type of tool, like a hammer and some big metal spike, he was beating the spike into some metal, it was like a big flat piece of shiny sheet metal. He was creating some type of design, however he was doing it to a rhytmic beat. It was almost as if he was a performance artist, yet creating art at the same time. I was just observing him. Then I was at some playground and again I was just observing. There was this little black kid who was on a seesaw all by himself. His brother was on one next to him but obviously didn't want to play with him. Then I hear kind of like a narrator who starts talking about this boy and explaining that he is kind of socially misfit. He talks about how the boy goes on to some private school and then ends up becoming a good kid. Odd. I remember one final scene in the dream that had something to do with the Sopranos but I really can't remember specifics."
434,I only remember a small piece of this dream. I think another portion had to so with my old pastor when I used to be christian *g*. Anyway I am in the lobby of some business type building and I run into my old friend from church Shawn Cook. We say hi. I told him I had just gotten a kick ass job with the government  and was working in the same building. He told me today was his last day at his job. That's really all I remember about the dream.
435," Last night I dreamt that I was going to a concert somewhere. I had the notion that it was at school and it was like somewhere in this auditorium where I hardly ever go. And I was trying to sneak in my mini disc recorder so I could record it, and I was, we were late, so we were rushing around, we were racing through the hallways trying to get to the auditorium, and somewhere on the way I picked up a handful or two or three of gravel from the ground, like stones and sand, and put it in a jar and put the jar in my purse, thinking that when I sat down in my seat and started to rig up my MD machine that the level of the gravel in the jar was going to be the level that I set my VU’s at. That was crazy. And so we got in there and, first of all, the concert was nothing like I expected it to be, and second of all, there was this lady who, I was taking out my jar of gravel and looking at the side to see how high up the jar it was, and the lady said she didn’t want that in there, she didn’t want me fiddling around with that during the concert. So I just put it back in my purse, and I just flew by the seat of my pants and started recording. And then, all of a sudden, I was at home, and Dad had this guitar that he sort of knew how to play, and he had it connected to an amplifier. And it was kind of new actually, and then I slowly faded into consciousness."
436,"Ok I will give you as much as I can remember. I actually got lucid at the end of this dream but I am going to write that up in a seperate entry. First thing I remember was there was this guy and he had a rifle. I was there with  other guys. All of a sudden he shot one of the guys next to us, I was a bit fearful for my life. Then he pointed the gun at my head. I closed my eyes and remember thinking if I would feel any pain when the gun blew my head off. Then I looked back up and the guy holding the gun was Lou Diamond Phillips. He just smiled at me and then walked off. I was relieved. I remember one of the guys that was with me was trying to think what he would tell the cops if the cops came. And he said he would say that he saw a girl hit him over the head. Of course I didn't question this but I do think the cops would have noticed the guy had actually been shot. LOL Then I remember seeing Lou again and he was on a stretcher getting put into an ambulance. He was still smiling at me, it was as if he was playing a victim so he could escape without the police knowing it was him. Next I remember being in some type of building/business complex. I went to this one receptionists desk and it was some place on physics. I went up to see if they offered any classes. I remember there being some sort of flyers and stuff there but don't remember anything significant. Then I am in some sort of house and I think a movie is being filmed but I'm not quite sure. Some lady then decided to move into the house and said she didn't mind that all these people there going to be there. I remember talking to her in the kitchen although I don't recall about what. Now I am outside walking through a neighborhood. I remember that I was going to use my powers to set some places on fire. I was walking by what I think was a church and with my mind I shot a few fireballs through the window. Then I continue walking down the street and this is where I begin to cross over into lucidity. I am walking down the street and see some big houses. I ""choose"" which is the right house and start walking towards it. It's not as if I knew that was the right house, I just picked one. I think this triggered something. As I walk I suddenly can't see but I can distinctly feel the ground beneath my feet, I am bare foot. I feel the sidewalk and I must have been walking crooked because I then feel my feet in the grass, and then finally feel them on the curb. then BOOM suddenly I know I am dreaming and become % lucid. I will continue the lucid part in my next entry *grin*."
437,"WARNING! Sexually explicit Dream! Ok this picks up where the last one left off. I suddenly am lucid and I am sitting in the upstairs hallway of what seems to be my old house  although it's slightly different. I know I am dreaming. I do my best to not wake up and to maintain lucidity. The carpet is a burnt orange brown color and it's kind of light. Now last time I had a lucid dream I tried to conjure up Sully Erna from Godsmack but it didn't really work out. So I immediately think about Sully in hopes that he will appear. I stand there and the hallway remains empty. Suddenly my ex boyfriend Aaron is there. This is the first guy I ever slept with. I walk up to him and grab his face and look at him. He looked exactly like I remember . I lead him into a room, there are  twin beds in the room, we hop in one. I am still fully lucid and keep reminding myself of this and that I am in complete control of where this dream goes. We lay down and begin to kiss. I could actually feel his tongue as we kissed, it felt SO real. Now we didn't actually have sex but suddenly he is gone. At that point things become hazy, I almost lose the dream, and I try to focus, and maintain awareness. Then I am back in the hall and I am still lucid. There is some celebrity there, and he is announcing names of other celebrities. I can't remember who he was naming but it was as if I had these people to choose from. Well he announced a name that made me think of Sully, even though that wasn't the name he said. So I walked back into the bedroom. Someone was sleeping in one of the beds. I said ""Sully is that you?"" and he said ""Yeah it's me"". I knew it was him because of his heavy Boston accent. I was HYPED. I continued to remind myself I was dreaming so I wouldn't lose awareness. I hopped into bed with him and we began to kiss. Once again I could feel the tongue, I was also totally turned on. Then we got up and walked over to the wall. He got down on his knees and pulled down my pants and went down on me. At first I couldn't feel anything. I tried to focus and then I was able to feel what was going on. The I decided to get on the floor. I pulled him on top of me in a  position and we began to mutually gratify one another. It was awesome! Suddenly I started to wake up, I tried to hang on but my neighbor was making noise and I knew it was over. "
438," It is the present day. In a large, flat field I watch as prisoners are beaten senseless by members of the Central Intelligence Agency. The victims are dragged off and thrown into piles, condemned to be shot. The bloodied, half-conscious men plead for their lives. The cruel agents ignore them. Then it is my turn. I get not to be killed, but the process begins."
439," Boy, this LED is bright in the dark. It’s almost blinding! Last night I had a dream that I was at school and I can’t remember what in the world we were doing and why I was there, but I had the notion that I was at Bancroft. And I also, then I suddenly dreamt that I was at this like outdoor sound studio under this little walkway, and I was at the sound board adjusting levels and stuff, and doing a test-test-one-two-three kind of a thing. And there were a couple of people on the other side, and I was recording all this on a mini disc. And then I dreamt that it was starting to rain and we had to get the board inside, a little shelf thing was taking on water. The two engineers and I kept dumping it as we went. And I know there was more of a connection; I just can’t remember it. It’s so frustrating."
440,"Another hotel dream. Ok  parts of this dream. One part I remember going back to my old church. Myself and a friend were sitting in the back, I must have gone to the bathroom, I came back and the row was full and someone had sat in my seat. I remember seeing the pastor's wife sitting on the end of the row, she looked at me strangly. I walked through the row and mentioned to the girl in my seat that I had been sitting there. Then I was just like fuck it and grabbed my stuff and me and my friend Chyrise moved up to another row. All rows up front were virtually empty. haha... Next part of the dream. I was in some sort of hotel, it was more like a small inn versus a large hotel. Myself and some female friend were staying there and I had a kitten with me. We were in the room and I gave the kitten some water and realized it would need food. So I went down to the front desk. I walk in and there was a young blond girl at the counter. There were also  cats in the room. They were all striped and multicolored and I noticed some purple and orange. I even commented on the fact that her cats were purple. I think I asked her if that was their real color of if they had been painted, she said it was real. Then I asked her if they had any cat food. She said they were out, I was a bit frustrated because I needed cat food.  But she said the - right behind me had some. I turned around and looked out the window and there was a - on the corner. I don't remember actually going to the -. I do remember walking into the hotel restaurant and my family was all there, I walked up to the table and that's all I remember."
441,"Ok I am in a bedroom and there are  little kittens there with me on the bed. They are tiny, probably a day or  old, couldn't even walk yet. The room is really cluttered there is crap all over the floor. I leave the bedroom and come back and  kittens are missing. I am frantic to find the kittens but there is so much crap on the floor that I can't find them. I am scared to move stuff around too much in fear that I will squish the missing kitties. I have no luck finding them. Then I leave the room again and come back and all the kittens are gone and a larger cat is sitting on the bed. I am freaking out because I think the larger cat has eaten or killed the kittens. I start looking through the clutter and I hear something meowing and one of the baby kittens springs up at me, so I catch him and put him on the bed. I have no luck finding the other five and am completely distraught. "
442,"I know my ex-boyfriend from college, Tracey was in the dream, although not sure I remember much about that. I was at the mall walking with someone and I ran into these two people. One of them was Teri this girl I went to college with. We were really good friends in college. I was like ""TERI!!"" and we hugged, it was very nice to see her. I remember telling her that I had been to Virginia beach a few times already and would be coming back this year. *She is from va beach* There was much more to this dream, just can't remember. "
443,"I am not sure how to describe the setting but there were these houses and they were really stores I think. Because we could go from one to another, go inside and visit etc. My mom was making some kind of crafts in one of them. At one point I am in one of the store/houses and I needed to go to the bathroom. This girl I used to go to church with named Sylvia  was there as well. She must have been ready to take a shower because when she found out I was in the bathroom she got mad. The door was semi- translucent  and she was hitting and kicking it. I was telling her to just wait a second and I would be out. Then I remember her psycho ass throwing a hammer at the door. Finally I leave the bathroom then I remember we were in a bedroom or something and Sylvia was still there I think she was mad because I had used her towel or something and she was commenting on it. There was another girl there named Kim who also went to my church in real life. She must have been on Sylvia's side it was as if they were scolding me and it pissed me off. Then we are outside and the rapper Snoop Dog is there. We are all talking to him. Actually it was me, Sylvia, Snoop and some other dude. Every time Sylvia would ask him something he would answer and then turn back and start talking to me. I found that funny and it was making Sylvia mad, which I was glad about. Then Snoop said he had to leave and I asked him if I could take a picture of him before he left. I went inside to get my camera, I was looking for it and couldn't find it. For some reason I remember I had put it in some locker at the store my mom worked at I was frantic because it was an $ camera and I was hoping no one stole it. I went back outside and told him I didn't have my camera. Some other girl had one and said she would take a picture. I asked him if he would be back later and he said yes, so I said I would just take one then. He said that was cool. He gave me a hug and then left. Then Sylvia and I are outside by ourselves. We begin talking about church and I went on to tell her why I left the church and chose not to come back. She was listening and seemed to be very understanding and it felt good to finally get it off my chest. I remember saying a few things about her dad  as well. Ultimately I told her I just didn't believe what they did and had to move on instead of being a hypocrite. I went back inside and called my mom. I asked her to go look in the center lockers to see if she could find my cameras. Then i was observing her as she was looking in the lockers I noticed she wasn't checking them all. She said she couldn't find it. So I finally went over there and found the camera in a locker."
444,"I am walking to a store and I see a small crowd of people and see  cats up on the roof. I get a better look and one is a kitten persian and one is a larger cat. The kitten looks similar to my old cat Roscoe. They were trying to figure out how they were going to get them down. The kitten actually belonged to a lady who owned the pet store down the street, the other cat belonged to someone else. Then this one couple walked by and I over heard them saying that they could hear the cats meowing a few miles away. I walk off and start heading towards another store. I see some guys putting boxes in there so I walk in and see all these t-shirts. I start going through them and taking the ones I like that I find in my size. One had this very cool design on it depicting the sun. I go into another store which looks like a bedroom there is all this stuff there that is mine and I need to take it back to the house and pack it. There are  guys there with me and I ask them to help me collect this stuff and bring it back. So we are all picking up the clothes and stuff. I see several pair of shoes and decide not to take them because they are all ugly and I would never wear them. As we are leaving the room/store there is one final pair of shoes on the night table. They look like berkenstock  sandals but when i turn them over the strap is really weird looking, and I laugh thinking that i would never wear them. We leave the store and get back to the house. There is some type of quiz show going on downstairs. We stop and decide to participate. The first  questions I am unable to answer so I am like fuck it and head upstairs. As I get upstairs this guy is sliding down the stairs and runs into me. He looks high, I attempt to get around him. Suddenly I am the guy and this black lady is coming up the stairs saying she needs to give me a drug test. She hands me this pill that i am supposed to suck on and I guess if it changes colors it means I am high. I suck it and give it back to her and it had changed colors. I am in observation mode now and see the guy who was high and another woman walking next to a horse who is being ridden by a little girl. The woman looks a little disturbed that the high guy is there. Still in observation mode I switch scenes and there are  people on this small bus and they are heading to the house I am in. The are arguing about something. The wife seems to have the upper hand in the arguement and then the husband says something that seems to make the wife feel really guilty, it was a real low blow it seems in order to get the upper hand, she seemed upset. Then suddenly I am the woman and we pass Hugh Grant wearing a purple suit and walking down the street with a suitcase towards the house. I remember thinking that he didn't have enough money to take a cab from the town to the house. I ask the bus driver to pull over and pick him up. I am back in the house and I look out the window and I see some kids running as if they were running a marathon. Then I am in observation mode again. I am looking at  people driving in a car, towards the house. Jennifer Lopez is sitting in the back  and she is holding a huge plant. She looks very pretty and has on some sunglasses and was just sitting there quietly, I observed her for a few minutes. Back in the house again I look out another window and still see these kids running, one of them looks up at me. Then everyone is downstairs and Hugh Grant explains that the plant was not actually for Jennifer  that it was for... and I woke up. At one point in the last dream I remember seeing this diagram. It was a picture of the sun and then a line extended from that sun to another sun. Then another line extended and there was a circle with a triangle inside. I heard someone describing the diagram as it began to move. The  suns were rotating around eachother in the circle but kind of in a triangular pattern. Weird."
445,"Ok I remember just a small piece of this dream. It appears I am back in school or high school although it seems to be present time. I am in some class and the teacher needs me and another guy to help straighten some stuff up in the back of the class room. I am concerned about missing the notes I will need and missing out on some quiz. Then the class ends I come back to my desk and see this girl Susie Moore, who had been sitting by me. I look at the books she is carrying and my notepad with all my notes is sitting on top of her stuff. I think to myself that she stole my notes. She walks off and I call her name and she ignores me walking faster. I run up behind her and I think I grab her by the hair to get her to stop and then I grab my notes, call her a thief and walk off. That's all I really remember."
446," Last night I had a dream that I was at a party at a three-story house. It was kind of a big house. I had a notion that it was the Rosses that were hosting it, but I didn’t know who was hosting it. And there were like these tables around with these snack things. There were like two or three bowls of snacks at each table. And there was a pool at this house. And there was like this man. We were on the second floor and we were on a balcony overlooking the pool and this man was like giving us very specific instructions about how to open bags of snacks and serve them, and when to put more out and when to leave the bowls empty, and not to put too much out. And on further analysis, I think this man must have been Mace, Barbara’s husband, because when they sent us our invitation, they gave us real specific instructions as to when to come, where to park, don’t bring a gift, and please let other people sit down and eat when you’re done, and all kinds of stuff like that. So I think that’s where that came from. Also something very strange – the past two times I have dreamt about hearing the “Wee Sing” tape, I’ve been really, really scared and wanting to cling to Mom when “Blue Bird” is about to come on. I stopped having dreams like that a while ago, and whenever I would dream about the tape, it wouldn’t be scary. But now I’m starting to be scared when I have those dreams, but not when I wake up, just in the dream. So I dreamt that all of a sudden we were in this bedroom at the house and the tape was playing and “London Bridge” was on, and Mom was going to do something, she was going to fill up more bowls of snacks. And “Blue Bird” came on and I just clung to her and I was like, “Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God” and I was ready to start crying and things. And then I slowly faded into consciousness and I woke up. I don’t know what all that’s about. But at least the good news is, is I don’t wake up really scared like I used to. I just wake up and it’s over, and I think about it and go, “Wow!” That’s strange."
447," Last night I had a dream that Mom and Dad both thought that I wanted a keyboard for Christmas and Mom didn’t know the difference between that and the sound board. And Dad – this is kind of funny – Dad found this like multi-track recorder that would record like ten minutes of audio and put these different little sounds on triggers, and it was kind of neat, but I don’t know, Mom said that it wasn’t the one. And then Uncle Fred told Mom and Dad what I really wanted. Next thing I knew, it was set up on a little tray like my typing keyboard is in my studio. Well, it was set up on a little tray in the TV cabinet in the living room, between the TV and the amplifier. And when Dad and I were sitting there listening to Celine Dion, I got up from the couch and moved the computer chair over in front of the TV cabinet and I pulled out that little tray, and we were hearing this the way it is, and I was trying to play it along with the CD, which I think it was a horrible job, but I don’t know. It was just a dream anyway. And then I stood up and I was going over to Dad to ask him how he thought I did. He was sound asleep. He was snoring away, which I thought it was pretty good because I really didn’t want him to see me and hear my anyway. Then the next time I sat down was when nobody was in the house, and I thought, “Okay, I am going to sit down and practice and do a decent job this time.” And I sat down and turned it on and it was not connected to the amplifier any more, so I sat down and started checking it out. The amplifier was as light as a feather, so I just lifted it off the shelf and turned it around and looked at the back of it, and it was nothing like I’m used to seeing when I’m conscious. There were no RCA  connections whatsoever. It looked more like the back of the car radio, which is probably because that’s what we were kind of doing like a few days ago. And I was trying to find a way to kind of jam some bare wire into some connection so that I could get this connection made and get this thing connected to the amplifier again. And just as I was doing that, I heard Mom and Dad coming home in the car and I had wires and connections and stuff all over the living room. And I didn’t want them to see that I had been messing around, so I met Dad at the door and said, “You can’t come in right now, I’m working on a surprise.” And he said, “Well, just guide me in, I’ll close my eyes.” And then I woke up, realized it was all a dream and said he can come in if he wants to. There’s no wires and stuff scattered all over everywhere; it’s a dream. That was weird."
448," Last night I had this crazy dream that I can’t remember what was going on. It was real clear in my head this morning, but Mom was snoring next to me and I didn’t want to wake her up by doing this then. But anyway, I dreamt that for some reason of other, the sink needed priming instead of the pump, in the kitchen sink. And for some reason we needed to run this great big hose from the pump outside into the kitchen, and we had to, instead of having the sink spray into the hose to prime the pump, we had to have the hose spray into the sink to prime the sink. And then, after spraying the hose into the sink faucet for a while, we had to spray the hose down into the garbage disposal and run the garbage disposal for a while. And it made the most horrible, horrible sound and it was the most horrible feeling to me. And somehow I had the notion that this had to be done because I like stayed too long at a party and left the sink running while I was gone or something stupid like that. And it made a sound that really scared me, and I was pretty sure, when I think about it now, I’m pretty sure I’ve heard it somewhere, but I don’t know where. So I know there was more to it, but I can’t remember now. That was kind of stupid."
449,"Here are the parts i remember... At one point I am at my old house where I grew up. I am walking up to the shopping center where someone is supposed to pick me up. It was night time. As I was walking I ran into this man. He pointed to a building down the street and said something to the effect that it was going to be demolished and I better leave. Then I saw something that said it would affect anyone within a  mile radius. Next I am with some people in a car we are driving to a night club I beleive. I don't think we ever got to the club. Then I am in some house and some people are sleeping. We go out and start going to these stores. I was looking for a store that sold rare books and other rare items. I got to this one store and this older man come up to me. I told him I was looking for rare items and then pointed out my nose ring to him and told him I got it at another shop that sold rare items. The walked me over to a desk and opened the drawer and pulled out this peach colored nose stud. I looked at it and it was way to wide to fit me. Then he proceeded to show me how to wear it, it was as if it snapped over the one I already had on. He said that you didn't even have to have your nose pierced to wear it. I am back at this house and I woke up one person saying we should all go to breakfast. Then we are at some diner and people are ordering things. One guy ordered some cheese sticks or something. I reminded everyone not to eat much since we were going out to breakfast. LOL Then we left the diner and went somewhere else. Not sure where we were exactly, but it was outside and there were a lot of people walking around. I remember there was this big grassy hill. Then I see a cop and think to myself that they must be coming for me because i left the diner without paying. And of course the cop and one other guy walked up saying I hadn't paid. I was like ""Oh my god I am so sorry I didn't mean to leave without paying"" and paid them what I owed. That's all I really remember. I know there was another part of the dream that consisted of the beach but can't remember specifics."
450," Last night I had a dream that Elizabeth and I were sitting out in the courtyard and we kind of lost track of what time it is, and I told her it was like : and it was the middle of the English class. So her and I went up the elevator, and the elevator was dark and I kind of lost her in the elevator, and then I proceeded to English class, but it was so late I didn’t want to go in without her. So I kind of ducked around down a flight of stairs and I kind of hid in a corner somewhere. And I was kind of like waiting for her, and she never came. And then I somehow made my way out to behind the gym and I was kind of walking back and forth out on the field while the people were having P.E. And then I made my way in into the girls’ locker room so I could get out. And I was getting ready to go out the front of the gym when I realized that the doors had Christmas decorations on them and they were all taped shut. They had like artificial pine bows with those crystal angels we saw at Eckards, and I got tangled in a bunch of wires because they had a TV and a VCR and stuff over there. And I dreamt that I was kind of like really skipping the last period too, so that it would look like I went home. And that’s all."
451,"Ok I remember  distinct parts to this dream, don't know if they were separate dreams or not. First part, I am in my mom's house, where I grew up. There was more to it then this but I only remember a portion where I was downstairs and water started rushing in. I ran into the bathroom and stood up on the toilet. Water was coming in and was a few feet deep. It was splashing in like big waves. I remember being scared that there might be sharks in the water. Next part of the dream. I am outside with some guys we are near a parking lot of an apartment complex. We are standing in the grass. I remember I had some weed  in my pocket. Then I see some cops, they walk up and one of the kinda frisks me, I think it's a lady cop. She stuck her hand in my pocket and pulled out the weed. I remember thinking I was going to be arrested but nothing happened. Then I am in my bedroom and I open the drawer and amidst all the crap in the drawer I see  baggies both with weed in them. I was hyped because I didn't know I had any. I put them together in the same back and hid it in the drawer. Next part of the dream. I was with some people, kind of a good guy/bad guy scenario. We are discussing some money that the bad guys owe us, and I guess they are going to wire transfer it or something. We leave but in the dream I am back with the bad guys observing what they are talking about and see that they are going to devise a plan to stop the money from transferring. Then I am in a dark cave like tunnel with some other people. We come to the end of one of the tunnels and we feel the wall, which is black, and it's soft. We realize it's a fake wall and begin to tear it down thinking that the bad guys are on the other side. That's all I remember."
452," I am with a large group of noisy veterans in a crowded restaurant. A menacing black man approaches. We argue. He begins shooting me point blank in the hip with a forty-five automatic, taunting me with every shot. I am screaming, “Stop it. Stop it.” Then I capitulate. He is right. I am wrong. I sense the bullets have missed my vital organs and that I will live. The next day I return with Ed W., who is dressed in full combat gear. I find the black man. With a small pair of scissors I quickly stab each lung twice, then puncture his heart. The skin of his chest fills with blood. “I’m sorry,” I say, mocking him. “I’m so very, very sorry.” I continue to taunt him until he is dead."
453,"Ok I only remember bits and peices, although I know why I had most of this dream you can read my comments below. Because I was so tired I didn't remember it all. I remember some situation where I kept getting called or paged and had to drive somewhere to fix an issue. I think it happened a few times so I was getting mad, it was night time and i was very tired. I remember feeling very tired in the dream. I can't for the live of me remember many details about this part. I do remember that i was finally ready to go home and go back to sleep but the person I was with was going to have to stop at some store. I remember thinking that last time he ended stopping at a bunch of stores and I wanted to get home. So I asked and made sure we were only going to stop at the one. Then I am at home, although not my home but it was in the dream. I am in the living room and my cat starts freaking out he hops up on the table and gets on his hind legs and is looking up at this light fixture. Something starts to come out of it. At first it looks like bugs, then I think it looks like bats. Of course if you think something in your dream it tends to go that route. So the small bug like creatures grew into bats. Although their heads were much bigger then normal and a bit animated. One of them was looking at me and kinda smiling. Then I was like, wait a minute this is not possible this has to be a dream. However I did not become lucid instead I woke up in my bed yet still dreaming, and was like whew just a dream. LOL dammit. Then some guy is in bed with me not sure who he was. We were kissing or something and I remember looking at his back and seeing this really huge scar right above his butt. In the dream I seemed to know why the scar was there and therefore it didn't bug me. It was as if it was the first time I was seeing it. Then I peek under the covers and I see that he is jacking off, I find it strange seeing that I was right there I would have gladly helped LOL and he actually had an orgasm, it was a bit odd in the dream. That was it I then woke up. "
454,"Most of my dreams jump all over the place this one was quite cohesive. Although I don't remember everything. I am with a friend of mine and she works for some Female Escort type service. She is telling me about it and that they have an event tonight. It's not like a normal Female Escort service, they don't go out on dates with guys or anything, they just hold parties are places like a restaurant and guys show up and just enjoy their company, no sex or anything is involved. She asked me if I wanted to come along to observe so I was like sure. Then she mentioned she needed to put on some makeup before she left. I remember we went into the bathroom so she could apply some makeup, we spoke more but I don't remember about what. Then we left and went to this restaurant. The guy who owned the company these females worked for was a nice looking black guy. As the get together got underway he came and sat down with me at booth and we were talking as if we already knew eachother. It seems he liked me and I had the feeling we were ""together"". We chatted for awhile but I don't remember the details. The restaurant was kind of dark, a lot of dark mahogany wood, very romantic feel to it, there were a lot of people there. Not just people that were there for the get together. I do remember at one point I asked him why he only had girls, why didn't he have any guys working for him, that I was sure some women would appreciate the company of a nice man for the evening. He showed me some photo of a guy who used to work for him  and just said that most guys weren't interested in that type of work. I decided I wanted to get out of there for awhile so I left and walked down the street into a theater. When I walked in there was some awards show going on, for some reason I remember it being the American Music Awards. I entered in the back where the stage was so I remember walking down the aisle towards the back looking for an empty seat. The seats were a light tan color. I came to a spot where there were about  empty seats at the end of two rows. I took the end seat in the  row. I looked up at the stage and they were interviewing some kid who was going to pick the winner for the next award and if he got it right he would win some prize. I guess he won because next thing I know he is walking down the aisle holding a surf board. I remember the kids face distinctly. He was only about  or  years old, he looked like he was phillipines or tibet, he was dark with dark brown hair and eyes and had an adorable face. The next person that got on stage asked if they could recite a poem first. The walked up tot he mic and said the poem was in memory of Lisa 'Left Eye' Lopez from TLC. She recited the poem which was only like  lines, and I can't for the life of me remember it. Then some white guy with blonde hair came and sat down next to me. I asked him if anyone was sitting here and he said no. Then he started to talk to me and we actually had a pretty indepth conversation but again I don't remember the details. He was flirting with me though and kept putting his hand on my leg. Then he stuck his finger in my ear and pulled it back out, I looked at him and laughed and hold him that I hoped he hadn't found any ear wax. LOL He said no he didn't. Then I decide it's time to go, so I head back to the restaurant. I get there and look around trying to find out where everyone is. I walk the long way around having to excuse myself as I walked between peoples tables, I emember having to move a few chairs out of the way. I finally made it back over to the booth. The black guy was still there, I sat down, and he asked where I went. I told him I just went out for a walk. That's all I remember."
455,"I had a short dream, I was in what looked like my mom's bedroom although it was changed around a bit. She had an armoire and in it was a TV. I opened the drawer and there were some video games. I picked one of them up and looked on the back. There were screen shots of the game, of these cute little characters. It was like a cuter version of Zelda or something. I remember thinking in the dream that I had already played this game or that maybe this was a newer version but that I had played one similar to it. That's all I remember."
456," As you can see, I’m kind of starting this tape off on a really bad foot because my singing voice is absolutely out of commission, and I was supposed to have a thing tonight, but I decided I wouldn’t be able to go because it’s not like my voice couldn’t do it, but my physical strength is like gone. So I’m glad it wasn’t any kind of a big audition or anything I had to do. I just hope that tomorrow is a big Christmas surprise for Mom and Dad and I hope I won’t have to disappoint the people I’ve invited. I just have to; there’s no way I can back out of tomorrow. Tonight is one thing, but not tomorrow. Anyway, to the point, this is right before Christmas. This happened to me last year. I had a dream last night that, well, I dreamt that I had to get up and go take my exam early in the morning, which I did that day. And I dreamt that I had some last minute audio editing to do on DP, and so I sat down and, first of all, the colors on the contrast were like all messed up and I like opened up one of those set up pages, you know how they go. I was having Mom read things off to me and I wasn’t making sense of it, and I was getting more and more confused and I kept losing the cursor, as I often do. And I finally said, “Okay, I’m shutting down and I’m getting out of here.” So I closed it down and set it down, and next thing I know, I’m at school and Mom’s a little late and I’m racing to get to Mr. Simpson’s class on time because I dreamt that it was his exam I had to take. And what the material of his exam was going to consist of was reacting appropriately to a fire drill. And we were racing to get to his class before the alarm class, and we didn’t make it. It went off while we were in the hall, and, you know, sound, acoustics-wise, the hall is the worst place you could be when the fire alarm goes off. Then I don’t remember too much more, and then I woke up."
457,"Ok this was interesting I went in and out of lucidity throughout this dream. I was at my mom's house and was sleeping over. I was sleeping in my old room. I had arranged my bed like a chaise lounge. Anyway I went to sleep. At about  she came home and I woke up, I said hi and then she went to bed and I went back to sleep. Then I start dreaming . I am down stairs and suddenly I say to myself, ""I must be dreaming."" I start walking up the stairs to my room and grab this piece of paper to do a reality check. I look at some writing on it and then look away and look back and it was different, I looked away again and looked back and it was different again. Bingo I was lucid. I walk back downstairs and my mom is there. I tell my mom look at this I'm lucid. And I walk up to the window and stick my hand through it  of my fingers go through the window, she just looks on kind of confused. Then I thought I should fly but something distracted me before I could. I think I woke up again, in the dream, and then was all excited because I had gotten lucid  so I go back to sleep to try again. Now I am downstairs in my mom's living room and there are people sitting around playing cards. I realize I am dreaming again but don't really try to take control I just go with the flow. Don't remember too much about this part. Then I was looking for some food, don't remember what I found though. One other part of this dream stands out. At one point a burglar was trying to break into the house. I remember being a little scared, although he never did get in."
458,I remember a small portion where I am looking in the mirror and noticing my hair had gotten really long. I was also slimmer. My hair was still blonde and just below my shoulders.
459," Last night I had a bizarre dream. I dream that there was, first of all, there was this thing that you could record video and audio while you’re sleeping, and it looked just like my mini disc recorder. And I asked Mom to show it to me and how it worked because I was curious. And, like I said, the main unit looks just like my mini disc recorder, and there’s this magnet that connects to it, and you have to put the magnet on the front of your good foot. And you have to like put this little candle thing on your shoulder. And then you have to take this microphone thing and wrap it around in a coil sixteen times, and let it sit on the bed next to you. And I said, “Well, isn’t this going to be obvious to whoever you’re sleeping with?” And she was like, “Well, the whole purpose of it is to catch somebody who’s not sleeping with you, like ____ and his girl coming walking into the bedroom, you could record them. And how about strange! And I dreamt that I was all mixed up on the calendar, like yesterday was the day before Christmas Eve, and really in my dream I thought it was the day before Christmas Eve, but it was really like a week before. And that’s all."
460," I am at a dance with an attractive woman who has promised me a place to live. Our friendship is platonic. Afterwards we walk down a snowy moonlit street. We are happy and young. She puts her arm around my shoulder. “I like you,” she says. “I really like you.” Then we sit in her car and neck. Our kisses are sensual, giving, tender. She removes her blouse and straddles me. Outside, a small wood sign is tacked to a street lamp. Its handwritten letters state, “Kit Karson Scouts.” I raise up and embrace her. “That’s gold,” I say. “Absolute gold.” Then we make love."
461," The day after Christmas. Today I had a dream that I was at school and Dad was in class with me, kind of watching me, kind of like Mom comes in sometimes. And I was in Health class, and we had this substitute that was just, she’s a black woman and she was just sitting back and letting the kids run wild. And Dad got so mad about that, he was going to call the school and everything and do everything he could to get her fired. And I said to myself, “I’m never having him come into school again.” And then I dreamt that the school had this like system of boardwalks and planks and exits and levels and stuff, and I wanted to get to the very tippy top. And I can’t remember exactly, but I told Dad I would meet him at : o’clock, and I was like walking around these different places and things, and I came down this dive ramp thing, I like walked down it and I was in the water. Dad was right there at the bottom of it, talking to somebody, and I like waded around in the water until it was time. And then I dreamt that I was at home and involved with concert information from Mrs. Dougherty. And I was just going to take it to the monitor and read it, and then I woke up."
462,"Ok first I am in a plane. I am sitting on the floor for some reason instead of in my seat. I look to my left and see another plane  come really close to our plane. Then I feel it hit. I suddenly know we are going to crash. I can feel the plane shaking. I didn't time to get into my seat and put my seat belt on so I just curled up into a ball against the seat and waited for us to crash. We hit the ground and I am expecting all this stuff to come flying down the aisle from the impact but instead we land with no problem. We exit the plane into what appears to be a very small airport. They tell us they will bring the luggage to us. They start bringing the luggage out and they just pile it all up in the street. It's night time and quite dark out. I spot my peice of luggage and grab it. Then I spot a purse I recognize and grabbed that too so no one would steal it. As I am doing that some guy comes up and grabs someone else's purse and starts to walk off. I scream out ""Someone stop him!"" and this blonde guy grabs him and gets the purse. He hands it to me and we look inside to identify whose it was. It had some papers in it but not much else. The purse was kind of ugly and cream colored. I don't remember what happened to that purse. Now I had picked up a purse as well it was black and had some kind of insignia on it. I went up to my friend and asked her if it was hers. She said no but she thought it was so-and-so's. Don't remember the name. So I went up to that person and it was her purse so I gave it to her. Then there was some other girl there who I walked up to. I handed her a check for $ and told her it was for something nice that she had done. I remember thinking in the dream that I couldn't wait to get home to tell everyone about this plane crash. Then I woke up slightly and realized it was all just a dream, I was very relieved."
463,"I only remember a portion of this dream but I know there was more. I was on a list to be in some contest. I don't remember specifics except I had to carry this girl  to a certain destination and by the time we got there she would have to be awake . The winner would win something. So I am running through streets and alleys, then I come upon this one guy, I think he was in the contest too. It appeared I would clearly win. I stopped and we were talking. He said he would pay me if I gave him the girl. I said ""OK for $."" Then he countered and said $, so I countered and said $. He agrees and hands me a VISA. I look at him like, um I don't take credit cards you dumb ass when suddenly the girl woke up, which is what I needed to win, so I said screw it. And handed him his credit card back. That's all I remember."
464,"I am back in school. It's present time and I am in a class, but not sure what subject we were studying. The teacher was an older lady, blonde hair. Towards the end of the class I have to go to the bathroom. I go down the hall to the bathroom, it's kind of dark and dreary. I go into the stall and sit down. Next to me is this small table with stuff on it. I looked around the table and first I see a contact lens case, the kind you get from the doctor that has the lens in it with the vision info on the case etc. I looked at the case and it said the strength of that contact was .. Then I see this small container and something is in it. It's extremely small probably  inches high and about an inch wide. I hold it up and it looks like some kind of reptile inside, emmersed in water. It was very odd looking. Was kind of spotted and had a little horn, some what resembling a frog. I was thinking to myself why is all this stuff in the stall? Then girl walks up, the stall walls are very low, and explains that it's her stuff. Then we start talking. Then this guy walks in, he was a student from the class I was just in and was coming in to check on me. I got really pissed off. Finally I was like ""look people would you fucking leave so I can wipe my ass and get back to class?"" haha... So they left, I finished up and went back to class. The class was empty except for the teacher and one student. There were all these formula's written all over the board up front. It wasn't a black board though it was a white board that you can use marker on and the writing was in blue. I walked up to the teacher and apologized for taking so long and then let her know I was really pissed off that that guy came in to check up on me. She gave me some explanation and then I left. Now it was time to go to chemistry class but of course I couldn't find my schedule. I am walking down the hall and / of the classrooms are barracaded and closed off. I keep walking hoping I will find where I need to go. Then I come to what looks like a section of a mall, there are all these stores. I go up to the information desk and ask if they have any class schedules, they say no but that So and So Rib place has some. Then I bump into this black guy, he is lost too and has no map or schedule either. We start walking together trying to find this Rib place. This is the wild part we were walking in front of these stores which were up on the  floor, there was no railing to keep people from falling down to the first floor. So we walk into this hair salon and ask if we can go out the back. There were  women in the salon. We open the back door and it leads to a street so we realize that's not where we want to go. We walk back out of the hair salon and on my way out I bump into a cigarette machine and it starts to tip over. I catch it and I remember looking behind it as I was putting it back into place and I saw a pack of cigarettes sticking out of the back. I put it back in place and head out of the store. Then I tell the black guy that I think I have a schedule on me somewhere and start looking through my purse. I asked him what class he was going to and he said ""Chemistry"". I said that I was too so at least we could be late together. I had no luck finding my schedule though and we were a bit worried because we didn't want to get kicked out of the class for being late. He was worried about getting detention and I reminded him this was college and they wouldn't give him detention for being late. We never did find the rib place or the damn class. I woke up."
465," I had a dream that there was this lady, one of my teachers, I guess – who had this box of CD’s and she wanted me to go through them and pick out a few of them that I wanted. So I went through them and they all looked kind of blah except for these two. They were both done by Celine Dion. One was called “The Little Green Captains” and it was like a real cartoony cover. But I had the notion that it was one of Celine Dion’s first albums, so I picked that one out. And there was another called “The Swedes” – you know, like people from Sweden, the Swedes. And it was the soundtrack to a musical where Celine Dion was the main girl in it, and it was done kind of like in opera except it was sung with regular voices and not operatic voices. And here’s how the story line basically went: there was this girl who lived in this big house and she was sick and tired of being a servant. And that’s the girl that Celine Dion played. And her two sisters were kind of competing to marry this rich guy, and one of the sisters died and one of the sisters found somebody else. And the rich guy was kind of left hanging, and the servant girl ended up marrying the rich guy and got out of being a servant, which is what she wanted. And there were, this CD, this story was told in songs on this CD. And I had this like baby CD player in my closet that I was playing this CD on, and it was light blue and it had like red buttons on it. And it was like for babies. And I’m in my closet listening to this, with my door closed, and Mom needed me to come downstairs for something, and then I woke up. But that was kind of cool. You know, maybe she will play in a movie. Singers who like go and act, I think they kind of get distracted from their singing. So it’s good that she never tried to act."
466," Last night I had a dream that we were having some people over, and this girl who was sitting next to me – oh no, it wasn’t just one girl, it was three or four kids my own age who wanted me to show them my sound equipment. Oh, I know what it was now! I had set up, well, first of all, I dreamt that all of my sound equipment resided on the computer desk downstairs and that the PC was really the Mac that ran this little performer, and it was all down there. And I had set it up in just a certain way, and there were these three or four people who wanted to see it, how it worked. And all of a sudden the three or four people dwindled down to one girl, and so I explained the difference between the two mixers – the Peavey and the tascam – but in my dream they were both black. Then this girl turns on the computer and she’s waiting for it to start up, and she doesn’t see a desktop right away and she gets a little alarmed, like, “Hey! Where does this reside in the…” and then she was like, “This program, Digital Performer you’re talking about, where does it reside?” And I was like, “Just be patient; it will come up.” And so when it came up, the desktop was green and I showed her the icon as to where to go and stuff, and I don’t remember too much about what she saw when she got in the program or what her reaction to it was. But I do remember all of a sudden there were a ton of people, like Uncle Carl and Aunt Joyce and a bunch of other family people and a bunch of the Fire Department people. And all of a sudden they wanted me to sing for them, so I go up and I start warming up. Now, you know that when I set up my equipment, I know at least a day in advance so I have a whole half an hour to set it up, to get ready to be amplified on the system. Well, I just wanted to have some accompaniment this time, and I had some stuff started on the CD RW, but my CD recorder is the only one that’ll play CD RW’s, so I was really in a rock and a hard place because what I was fixing to do was record it onto a tape and play the tape on Mom’s boom box while I sang along and not involve the sound system this time, which is what I did, and I came downstairs with the boom box and I set it up, and all the people were gone. There was only like one person and Dad in the living room. And Dad was like, “You’d better go out there and yell to them. They’re all in their cars.” And so I went out there, and I yelled, “Hey, you guys!” And they were all gone. But the bird was just going nuts, screeching and screeching and screeching. So I yelled at him, I was going, “Hey, Archie, stop!” And at that point some car honked its horn. It had a really funny sound to it. And then I went back inside, and I figured, “Well, that’s a wash. That was a lot of work for nothing.” And even the girl was gone, who was supposedly looking at Digital Performer. And so I went upstairs and I was arranging some stuff back to the way it was, and I realized that I had left the sub on from the last time I had the sound system on, and you know how they require more power and so they have their own amplifiers. So you gotta click the switch on and off, so I forgot to click the switch off and I could hear that it had a little bit of chubba chubba chubba chubba sound, which meant there was an internal cooling fan cooling it off. And so I figured I’ll shut it off so it’ll quit getting hot and it’ll cool itself off. So I reach down, I clicked the switch off, but when I did that, its fan like kicked in full force and it blew all this warm air out at me, and I was like so spooked by that and I ran out of my studio with a yell! And that was funny! And I was still spooked and I jumped up on my bed, and I set my hand down and there was a moth ball under my covers, but I got so scared, I thought it was either a mouse or something. So I screamed again. And Dad was like, “Are you alright?” And then I woke up. That was crazy, man."
467," I had two dreams last night. I dreamt that, first of all, I was at school and Mom and Dad were going to pick me up. And I was going out to the truck and I realized I forgot my book bag, so I had to say, “Hold on a second, I’ve gotta get something and I’ll be back real fast.” So I went in, there was a whole crowd of people in the courtyard and I found where I had dumped it. And I went out and that was that. I went home. "
468," And then I dreamt that Mom and I were getting ready to take a walk somewhere, and we were sitting in chairs at the house next door to Joan’s house, just kind of resting for a minute and Dad was watering his trees. He started yelling at Mom for something and then he started walking away. And I picked up a cinder block that was sitting in the sand and I threw it at him, but I didn’t hit him fortunately. And he turns around and he throws it back at us, but he doesn’t hit us, fortunately. That was weird. And this is the most startling and weird part of all. It wasn’t scary, but it was weird. It was disappointing. I dreamt that Mom’s Bose wave radio CD and her boom box both needed batteries to run. Her Bose thing needed AA’s and the boom box needed C’s, like it’s always needed. And I dreamt that they were both prone to falling out of the machine, and with both machines, if the batteries would fall out while the machine is playing, it would start making this, “Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo” sound instead of your audio. And you’d think if it would still have enough power to make that sound, you’d think it would have enough power to keep playing your audio, but no! So I dealt with that for a while, and in my dream it was scary, and so I was thinking up all kinds of ways to tape the – the thing of it is, I don’t think the boom box had a door to keep them in and so they would fall out. And so I thought of taping them, but I woke up before I could do that."
469," Last night I dreamt that somehow I got pregnant, but not by making out with some guy. I think Mom took me to the doctor and had an egg implanted in me or something, and I got pregnant. And I was going to have a baby that was going to be just like me, so that when I grew up and was out of the house, she would still have a Jessie to raise. And so we were at the beach and I was going to have the baby in the salt water to make things a lot easier and to make it so I wouldn’t have to go through so much pain of labor and stuff. And I started having the baby and the head popped out, and I was asking Mom, “Does my body naturally push or do I have to act like I’m going poop?” And she said, “It naturally happens,” and the baby was starting to come out and we were going out deeper and deeper into the water. And then when the baby’s body started coming out, it was like really, really painful and Mom was like lifting me up to the top of the water and putting me down in the water, and lifting me out of the water and putting me down in the water, thinking that it might shake the baby out. And then the baby came out and fell down to the bottom of the water and was going to drown, so we pulled it out real quick and we raced up to the shore. And there was a whole hullabaloo going on up there. I don’t remember why though. And there were these clowns and things running around, and we got out and showered off like nothing happened, and then we were going back to the water. And this woman was there, and she said, “Is that….?” I had to tell her that this baby was Mom’s granddaughter, and oh, it was weird, and I don’t remember too much more."
470,"Well I should have written this down sooner so I have forgotten a bit of it but here is what I remember. I was living back at home with my mom, dad and brother . At one point I remember being down in the basement, I think I was looking for my brother. My mom came down and she noticed there were these really nice buds  on the top of the television. At first I thought it was my weed and that I had left it there but then realized it wasn't. She assumed it was my brothers, so did I. She started to pick it up and I went to help her, deliberately knocking it onto the floor. I was thinking I would pocket a bud or two if I could do so without her seeing me. I managed to get at least one. Another part of the dream I remember my brother being in it but can't remember anything specific. There was also a part with my dad and I remember we had a conversation about our relationship and what a shitty father he was, but I can't remember any specific things we said."
471,"OK I was at my mom's once again. I was sleeping in the guest bedroom because someone was visiting and sleeping in my room. I woke up and went down stairs. There were all these people in our house. I walked into the living room and there was this young guy  with brown hair sitting int he living room. It appears I knew him and it also appeared that I liked him or had a crush on him. I sit down on the floor and start talking and then I realize I only have on my tshirt and underwear and get embarrassed. I leave and go back upstairs to get dressed. I go into the bathroom to take a shower. When I am in there my cat Roscoe  walks in to the bathroom. He is a copper colored persian with really long hair. Anyway, he was shaved completely except for the hair on his head and tail. . So I was like ""Who the fuck shaved my cat?"". I walked out into the hall trying to find the culprit. And someone said ""Buddy was shaved too."" . I seemed annoyed but didn't pursue it. I finally took a shower and then after the shower I was trying on this hat and it looked really cute. Then I go into my bedroom to get dressed and I see the ""visitors"" suitcase on my bed. It was a black suitcase with a red stripe. Then, I can't find the hat that I was just wearing. It was a red and black hat. I start going through things in my room and can't find it. I go into the guest room which is extremely cluttered and start looking through things. I find  hats that are very similar but not the right one. One of them I put on and it's way too big and covers my eyes. Then I finally find the hat. It was red with a black adidas logo on it. I want some earrings to match so I go back to my room, the ""visitors"" suitcase is now closed and on the floor. I go over to a drawer where I kept all my earrings. I start going through everything, there was a lot of really cool looking jewelry in the drawer. Finally I find  pair of red earrings but one is broken and the other is missing a back so I can't wear either, I was frustrated. Then suddenly I look at my nose and it appears my nose ring is missing. I get quite frantic because it's very small, wondering where the hell it could be. I don't find it. Next I am getting into the car with my best friend Chyrise. We have to go to the mall. We get there and go inside for something . When we are coming out of the mall to leave we see this one area roped off by the police with that yellow police tape. My friend Chyrise walks right through the tape and starts walking up this huge paved hill. The cop runs after her asking what she is doing. THen I was like ""Chyrise where is the car?"" She says it's on the level I am on. So I am thinking ""well why the hell is she going up that hill then?"". I remember going back home but that's about it."
472," I don’t remember too much about my dream last night, but I do remember this: it was kind of funky! There was this company called CP Dock and Surround Affairs, and I had remembered hearing about them one or two other times and in my dream they were coming in our yard to put a pipe – for some reason put a pipe from under the house in the ground up to the back of where the computer desk is. And that could have been _____, but I don’t know why. And, oh yeah, I was just f____ in the dream. And when Dad got home I heard the reason why they put that, I don’t know why they put the pipe there, but there was ________. They had taken a broken dock away from another house and they were going to give it to us so that we could put cement out on it and sit out by the alley and listen to surround sound on the little cement dock. That was crazy, man!"
473,"What I remember to be, a really cool dream last night and of course don't remember squat. I do know my dad was in the dream. I also remember one scene where these  guys were being pursued by police or security or something, they were near the beach and they had a canoe so they got away via the water, that was at the very end of the dream. The rest of it had something to do with some event that was going on. Myself and a bunch of other people were going to partake, but I can't remember any of the details. If I do later I will come update this entry. "
474,"Ok bits and pieces is all I remember. I am in my house, some guy is there with me. I think he had spent the night. It's morning and he wants to have sex. He also had this little device that he showed me, was kind of like a ""self stimulating"" device and he wanted to try it out on me. I was game but I have to do something in the living room first. When I am out there I notice the time it was like :. And I remembered someone was supposed to pick me up at . So I tell him that we may have to postpone but that I will call and find out what time they are coming. Then I remember that Bea  was going to come pick me up, along with some kid and we were going to go to this place about  hours away. I don't remember much except it was some ranch and I was going to be able to ride horses. I also remember cleaning the kitchen before they got to my house. The counters had stuff all over them and i remember using a sponge to wipe it all up. "
475," Last night I dreamt that I had a bunch of Celine Dion CD’s and somebody gave me like one or two to add to my collection, and I was at somebody’s house and I came home and I had this box of cookie cracker things and two of the CD’s were loose in that box without a case. And I took them off and I washed them with water to get all the cookie crumbs and goo off of them, and then I put them in jewel cases and the ones that I have were professionally done, but there were three extras that were like hand-made, hand decorated and home burned. And I dreamt that I was going to put the Celine Dion CD’s in the order that they came out, the order that she released them, and I started on that and I had the notion that she sang “Part of That World” on the Mermaid movie, when it was really Jodie Benson. And there was this one CD that was pink and it had some hearts, and it was one that was like handmade. And I put that one in, because I thought that was the one that had “Part of That World” on it, and it had like a bunch of other stuff, but it wasn’t one of those collector series CD’s like I thought it was. And before I could do any more organizing, I woke up."
476,"Ok I am upstairs in the hallway of my old house. Some man  is there. It's very dark, just a little bit of light coming from a lamp in my mom's bedroom. Me and this man were supposed to be going somewhere, although I don't know where, but I didn't want to go. I told him that I wasn't feeling well. Then he handed me a thermometer as if he wanted me to prove to him I was sick. So I put the thermometer in my mouth and was walking up and down the hall waiting for him to turn his back. I figured as soon as he wasn't looking I would put the end of the thermometer on a lightbulb so the temperature goes up . So he had his back turned, I went into the guestroom and turned on the lamp  and stuck the thermometer on the bulb. I pulled it back and looked at the temperature and it was . Um a bit too high. So I started shaking the thermometer to get it to go back down and looked at it again it was . Still too high. I shake it vigorously some more and look at it again and it's . Dammit too low. So then I put it back on the light bulb for just a sec, look at it and it's at . Finally. Then I walk into my mom's room. The man is now my dad and my mom is there with him. They are looking through a folder of papers of mine. Actually they were all school projects and art projects that my brother had done in elementary school but my mom had given them to me. I tossed the thermometer down next to my dad to show him I had a temperature, however he didn't even notice. He started looking through the papers and was crying. I felt no sympathy for him and was really mad he was looking through it, since it was my stuff. I figured he would end up keeping it or ripping it up, at least that's what I was thinking. That's all I remember."
477," I had kind of a goofy dream last night, kind of, almost not tape-worthy, but it’s kind of cool so I think I’ll put it on anyway. I had this dream that I was taking this final exam for this art class, and what I had to do is, they took a picture of us and they cut it in half and they laid one-half of it down on the paper. And we had to draw in the other half and make it look exactly like the picture. And that was our final exam. Well, I tried that, but I kind of game up and I started drawing all kinds of doodley things. I drew this housewife figure who was running around doing stuff. I drew this really kooky figure of myself and I drew a couple of other doodles. And I had this whole big set of markers and stuff out all over my desk, and they were like rolling off and falling off, and then it was kind of time for me to go. Mom was there to pick me up. And then I had the realization that it wasn’t really a serious final exam; it was just sort of a doodley fun thing, and so I took all my doodles with me and I was putting all these markers away, and some of them went into my little art kit and some of them went back to the teacher. It was kind of a guy like Mr. Kitchen, kind of like. Oh, I remember drawing this angel in a plaid jacket, and saying that she was an audio angel, like she did something, and her stuff was like inside of her. And what you had to do is you had to like unsnap her jacket and there would be her sound controls on the front so you wouldn’t have to go through all kinds of other stuff trying to get to them. That was just kind of goofy! And I can’t remember anything more."
478," Last night I had this dream that I had to stay after school for, oh no, I was sitting in this room taking a test. It was kind of like math class, but it wasn’t. It was like some room I’ve never been in. And this fire alarm box in the back of the room had these like wires attached to it, and what you were supposed to do was attach the wires to some kind of big appliance, and if the big appliance gets too hot, it’ll go off. So everybody in the class gets this form to fill out about what they’ve done in the school year, and so I’ve ______, and so we’re all sitting there writing our papers and the room is so quiet, and this boy in the back of the room is sitting there fiddling with these wires. And Elizabeth and me are both telling him to stop, but he won’t. And then the class starts getting all more commotiony. And then for some reason the teacher switched off the lights and put them overhead, and was teaching us how to write ’s so that they looked good – you know, how they used to teach us how to write letters in kindergarten? Well, this teacher was so upset with the way we’d been writing ’s. She wanted to teach us how to write them right. And then the class cleared out and Mrs. Dougherty came by and said, “If you wait here fifteen minutes, I want to come back and practice with you.” Well, I was waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting for it felt like two or three hours, and I went to this little room that had a bathroom. And I took my clothes off and left them in the bathroom, and I went to the bathroom. By the way, I really did have to do when I woke up. And it was getting dark outside and I thought that it was like way past the time when I was supposed to go home, so I was going to call Mom and Dad, but just as I was going to call, Mom came up to get me and said that she had been vacuuming the track and so it took her forever. That was crazy."
479,"Ok I remember bits and pieces of this dream. Bit . I am in my mom's house. Some guy comes over  with some black girl. Everything seems ok but then the black chicks starts walkin through the house going through things. This pissed me off, I was like, ""What the fuck do you think you're doing?"" She just kept right on. I was on the phone with my mom and told her I was gonna call the police, the girl heard me but it didn't seem to phase her. I think she was in my mom's bedroom by this point. Not sure what happened after that. Bit . I am still at my mom's house. It's night time. I look outside and there are  cars driving up the street. One slams on his breaks and then the other  collide. They were all really big cars like Lincoln Town Cars or something, one was black, not sure what color the others were. Then the people who were in the cars are at my door. I beleive I recognized them as good friends of the family, although I don't remember much else about that. Bit . I am at my friend Chyrise's house. We must have been out somewhere together because we were arriving at her door together. She opened the door and her bathroom was straight back . Her husband was standing in the bathroom with a button down shirt and some boxers on, holding his pants. He seemed embarrassed and ran upstairs. Now we are in her house and I remember some white kid being there and that it was her husband's son. The kid had blonde hair. Although her husband is black. The kid had some friend sleeping over as well. At one point in the dream I must have complained that my back hurt and Chyrise gave me this massage thing that I put in the drivers seat of my car to massage my back while I drive. "
480,"This dream was actually quite long but of course i only remember a few pieces. The dream actually took place over several days because I remember going to sleep for the night on at least  occasions in the dream. We were at a hotel I believe, possibly at some conference or convention. My good friend Mike was there but I don't know if we were rooming together. I remember at one point in the dream I felt jealous about some other female that wanted to get to know Mike. At one point towards the end of our stay I suggested we all skip the conference and go down to the beach. Everyone seemed to agree. I was looking for something to wear but can't remember details about it. Then I was talking to some guy about where we would go and where we would park. At that point I believe I thought we were at Virginia Beach. We discussed how we could park a block or  from the main intersection. As we discussed that I actually could see the busy intersection with cars etc and saw the spot where we would park. It was as if I was looking at the scene overhead. There was a lot more to this dream but it seems to have faded away."
481,"Ok I was playing on Tetrinet before I went to bed so it incorporated it's way into my dream but a bit hard to describe. Anyway as to the part of the dream I remember. In the dream I am this young boy. He goes to some house and his mother was there. This was the first time he was meeting his mother, it seemed. Maybe adopted. It appeared quite emotional for the child. There was some video tape playing of the boy and his mom up on the wall when he was very young. Then I/he had to leave. When we came back the mother was gone. Gone for good it seemed. This was very distressing, because he knew he wouldn't see her again. She left something behind that he took, although I don't remember what. As to the Tetris portion. Well in the game tetris you move and manipulate pieces. Well throughout the whole dream that was happening. Although instead of pieces being moved it was either people or ideas. So there would be a thought or idea and suddenly it would be moved and rearranged. Very hard to explain."
482," Last night I had two dreams, actually three. The first was I dreamt that I was having Arlene over for dinner before we were going to take off on the car trip with her somewhere. And I had my tape machine recorder in my purse so that I could record what was going on, and I had my purse on my shoulder and going downstairs with Arlene behind me. And Mom said, “Tell Arlene about when you had Andrea over for dinner and you recorded everything that was going on.” And I didn’t want to tell Arlene that. I didn’t even want to tell Arlene I was recording now. So I just kind of went down, and we sat down and started eating. "
483," And then I kind of faded into this other dream that we were at a toy store, Mom and I. It was kind of small when you first walk in, but then you go through this little door and you’re in this big huge area like a real store. And we were looking for something for Bobby. I still had the notion that he’s this toddler and we have to look for toys for him sometimes. I guess we always used to until he started coming of age like me. And anyway, I can’t remember any specific toys that we were, anyway, I was looking around at these different toys, but I don’t remember any specific ones. "
484," And then we had this exit into this other crazy dream that Mom was telling me about all the kinky things that people do to each other, like sometimes people throw darts at each other, and I don’t know, just other crazy stuff. They take empty bottles and they pour beer all over each other and they throw beer caps at each other. And I don’t know why, but I had the notion that people actually liked that. That is far-fetched, man. And she was telling me about all these things because she was wanting to know if I had actually gone that crazy yet. And I told her, “No way, Jose.” And then I think there was more, but I think I just faded into consciousness after that."
485," Last night I dreamt that we had a black chicken that we found somewhere, and we took her in. And she had kind of a deep-from-the-gut balk like Loretta has. And she was a foreigner to the others, of course, and we had two white chickens in this dream. So two white chickens and a red one, plus the black one that we found. And the black one was a foreigner to the others, so they would always shoo the black one away. And I had to distract the others and feed the black one. And she wasn’t real tame and we had to tame her and like hold her and talk to her to get her to like us better. And I don’t think we’ve ever had a black chicken. And then I dreamt that I was keeping up with Mrs. Hammondand her AP test, and I dreamt that she had totally no confidence in me, that I was going to do well at all in my AP test. She just totally thought I was going to not pass. And she wanted me to come in when she gives her class a practice test, and she wanted me to take it. And I was so nervous because I didn’t want her to have my head if I didn’t pass the AP test. And then I woke up."
486,"Ok I was at my neighbors house. It appeared to be the neighbor's house next door to where my mom lives. There were  other people in the house with me, a teenage boy and a woman in her 's. We were down in the family room and some little kid came to the door. He looked hawaiian, and seemed to be about  years old. The teen boy went to the door but wouldn't let the kid in, not sure why. He seemed angry that he couldn't get in and left. Not sure what happened next but then we realized the little kid had come back with a gun. I walked to the front door, it was open. I was with the girl. We both looked down and their was blood on the step in front of the door. She freaked out because there was a baby upstairs and we thought we heard something. So we go upstairs. Next thing I know the little  year old's sister walks into the room. I felt very uneasy as if she was trying to trick me into staying until he came back so he could shoot me. Then I believe I realized I was dreaming and therefore knew nothing would happen. And so even though I was on the  floor I kinda teleported myself outside and ran to my moms house. Although I didn't become lucid fully or anything. I remember then seeing this scene of the little kid and his posse walkin down the street as if they owned the neighborhood, it was kind of humorous. I was at my mom's house and some more stuff occurred but since I failed to right the dream down this morning and waited all day  I have forgotten. If I remember I will update it."
487,"Ok I was at some place, not sure what it was. Kinda like a big office complex. I remember this one portion where I realized it was a drug rehab and I was there for treatment. I walked into this room where they were having a meeting and people could get up and speak. I was like ""fuck that"" and turned around and started to walk out. Then I over heard someone say something to the effect that I was scared to go up there. That made me turn back around and come in so I could prove them wrong. Although I still planned on leaving the rehab after I spoke. As I sat there I was thinking about what I was going to say. I was going to tell them that I was not comfortable at the rehab because of everything my brother had gone through when he was in rehab. I was going to get up and tell the whole story about his abuse etc. As I was thinking about it I also realized I would probably end up crying which I didn't want to do. I never did get up to give my speech though. That's all I remember."
488,"I only remember the tail end of this dream. I was in some big room with lots of people. And there were  furries . They were both big teddy bears. Basically their fur suits looked like giant teddy bears rather then a furocious bear. Anyway they were on the floor and one was laying on top of the other and they were kinda makin out, i guess as much as one can in a big suit like that. Then I woke up."
489,"I was in a parking lot, and was walking to my car. There was a car next to me with a guy putting stuff in the trunk. As I got closer I realized he was some celebrity  he was a white guy, with curly brown hair, probably in his 's. It appeared he was putting golf clubs in his trunk. So I walk up to my trunk and open it and then I put down this bag, I must have been carrying. I opened it and took my golf clubs  out and put them in the trunk. This caused him to say something to me and we started talking. I ended up going for a ride with him. Now his car is suddenly this weird looking thing. It was really long and narrow and had no top. I could hardly fit into it. Then we arrive at some place where he was going to visit his daughter. There is a small concrete wall about  feet high. There were visitors on one side of the wall and the the people they were visiting on the other side. I think it was rehab or something. I got the impression they were mistreating the people inside. I remember this blonde girl coming up and talking to us. Then for some reason I got the impression that this was my long lost father . That's all I remember."
490,"I am driving my car  down the street. I approach a red light and the car in front of me  stopped short. I ended up ""bumping"" the car slightly. I was like ""oh shit"" now their gonna get out of the car and we will have to report it. But instead she must have taken her foot off the break because she moved forward and an oncoming car slammed into her. Her car went flying into a ditch. Then from an observer  point of view I saw her lying there on the ground unconscious. I am back in my car and thinking of whether or not I should pull over. I decide against it because I am worried that I will get in trouble. Then I think about the fact that what if someone reports my car and license plate to the police, they may come after me later. Then I think that no one else saw so it should be ok and i decide to drive on, feeling guilty. I arrive home  and it turns out I am going to be on that MTV show The Real World. Although some of the other people that were going to be on the show were previous cast members. The guy Puck was going to be one of them. Then some people from MTV came over  and they were asking if I was going to wear what I had on. I said no I had to go change. I go upstairs and start looking for clothes. I am looking for a nice pair of black slacks and finally find some. I put them on and then when I look in the mirror I realize they are shorts. So I find another pair and was also looking for this really nice red and black shirt. Then my room suddenly looks like my old bedroom that I was in when I grew up. Suddenly all these people come down the hall to the bedroom door. I quickly shut the door not wanting to let them in. There was one girl in the room with me but that was it. Then I open the door and ask what they want. I think they wanted to come in but I wouldn't let them, one of them appeared to be my pastor's wife . Finally they leave. That's all I remember."
491," This is the most bizarre dream I’ve had in a while. I dreamt that there like these friends that I had over at the house. There were like three or four of them. They were kind of okay at first, but then they kind of didn’t want anything to do with me. And somehow I had the notion that we had a fire alarm system in the house, and that Dad and I were sitting out in the back yard reading or something and they were in the kitchen helping Mom bake a pie. And somehow they knew they knew that she was going to burn something in the oven and that it was going to go off, so they came out of the house and they got in back of the truck, in the bed of the truck, and I was like, “What are you guys doing in here?” And they were like, “I don’t know; we don’t want to tell you.” And I kind of figured that it was probably going to go off so I climbed in the back with them, and there was just enough room for me to like lay down. And it was real greasy and kind of dirty back there. And Dad got in the cab of the truck and started it up and drove us away, and drove us around the block a few Dickes. And then I dreamt that somebody was getting married and we had to go see them get married, and that they were going to like walk down the street any minute with their stuff. And one other thing – I dreamt that I was looking through this book of biographies on techno singers, and I was looking for the girl who sings, “Come Into My Planet Soul.” I can’t sing at this hour of the morning! And I couldn’t find her, and then I think I woke up."
492,"Ok this was a wild one. I am attending some school. Its' like a college I guess. I think i was there for music  but for some reason i ended up having to do ""fashion"" related classes. . We had to put on some fashion show. I really didn't want to be in it and remember arguing with some girl to that effect. I think I left and then I ran into some friends who were driving down the street. We went and got a drink and then went back to the fashion show. During one part of the dream, I threw water on a girl because she did something to piss me off, although I don't remember exactly when this occurred in the dream. Then I am sitting in our ""dorm"", it was more like a house that we all shared. A package came for some girl who we didn't know, so we opened it. It was like a care package, had things like lotion and candy etc. Then this girl walks up and asked why we had opened her package. I felt really bad and tried to come up with some explanation. She seemed a bit angry and I was worried she was going to report us or something. Later in the dream I got called into the office of the headmistress . They kicked me out of the school for the water and package incident, as well as some other thing. So I came back home and moved in with my mom. I called Chyrise and told her about it. I told her the school was full of shit anyway they were only concerned with appearance and not learning. Then I am watching TV and I see Chyrise and this other girl in a canoe, next to this really big yacht and they start performing this song acapella. I was shocked because I realize she had joined the school I had just been kicked out of. I am really pissed at this point. Suddenly I am there where the boat is. I jump into the water so no one will see me, and I dive under, way under, until the boat passes. I was able to breath underwater, even though I didn't find that unusual. Finally I am ready to come back up and I begin to approach the surface, although it seems to take a good while. My head pops out of the water but instead I am looking out from under some sheets on a bed. I see someone standing over me and getting ready to hit me with a big  by , so I go back under. I had a feeling it was my mom. I come back up again and there is some kind of floatation device I am holding on to. Then I see a shark. I get a little scared. It comes up to me and tries to bite me. I am basically swimming backwards as I hold onto this float thing. As I face the shark to keep my eye on it. It keeps coming at me and I keep bopping it on the nose. I start looking for land. In the water there are all these trees but they are just sticking out of the wather, there is no actual land I can go to. Then the shark tries to come up on the side of me and he latches on to my left arm. Although I felt no pain, I somehow get him off my arm. Now I am out of the water and back at the school, I am there to find Chyrise. I go into the bathroom and she is there. I walk out and wait for her. I call her name and she comes over. I start crying and tell her I can't believe she did this to me by being a traitor and going to this school. I tell her i am moving to california in  months . She askes if she can come and i say i dont know. she starts crying. Finally i leave and on the way out of the building i run into the headmistresses son. It was the actor Matthew Davis . Anyway I guess he liked me because he saw me and gave me a big hug and we started to kiss. I felt very relieved, we just stood there and held eachother. He told me he knew his mom was full of shit and that I shouldnt have been kicked out.  Then we go to a hotel together. Someone else is rooming with us. We tell him he may want to get his own room. But then we realize he is safer staying with us so he stays. Then he says ""But im not having a twosome with you Kelly"". I assume he meant -some and I just laugh. Now bunch of us including Matthew are at my moms house. Some jeep pulls up and I walk out in just pants and a bra, I realize they are here to see matthew and walk back in and then I hear them laughing. It really bothers me. When matthew comes in we talk about california. He said he lived in Jackyville and it was extremely hot there and near the Atlantic. i got confused because I thought he meant Jacksonville  and the Atlantic is not near Cali. So I asked again if he meant California. He didn't answer but someone else said yes it was. Then he explained the guys were laughing because as they pulled up they morphed in to someone else. Then we saw a playback video of how they morphed and the guys were girls in the video. It's kind of hard to explain. Now i am in some auditorium with Chyrise. not sure what it was for. Someone asked me if i played guitar and i said i was just learning. Then i see matthew across the auditorium, he is smiling at me. I stop smiling and he stops. I smile and he smiles. I see him lean over and kiss this girl I used to go to school with, named Susie, on the cheek. Then I woke up."
493,"OH GOD this was frustrating but a typical situation with a phone call in a dream. Anyway this is all I remember but there was more to this dream. I am with some group of people. I remember one guy coming in and saying he was late because he had to stack these chairs at a hotel and it took him forever cuz they had to be stacked to the ceiling. I have no idea who any of these people where. I hear some girl say that this other chick is going to score some weed. So I decide to call this chick and see if she could hook me up. I go to call her but have issues with the phone. Then the girl who I am about to call comes up and shows me how to fix the phone. After that I was like ""well you are who I was going to call"". We walk over to the side and I ask her if she can hook me up. She said she doesn't know if it's going to come through but if it does she will go / with me because he has a limited amount and she wants a certain amount. I was like ok. Then I decide to call my ""hook-up"" Kevin to see if he has any. I call him up, and he answers. I asked him if anything was ""going on"", he knows what that means, we never talk specifics on the phone. He was like yeah except it's ""heroin-like"". I was like ""what the fuck do you mean heroin-like?"" I was thinking to myself how could it be, you can't shoot up weed, it doesnt come in a form like heroin. Then i saw an image and the weed were these paper thin strips instead of buds. Still not sure how that was heroin-like. He said it was $ dollars for an /. Have mercy. I said ""it must be good then which means it will last a long time."" He said, ""yeah but..."" and i don't remember what came after the but. I then asked him if he would be home later because I didn't get off work until  . I looked at the clock and it was about :. He said no he wouldn't be home then, so I was going to say I would just come now but the connection went dead. Suddenly it was back, I was like ""Kevin? Kevin?"" I could hear him but he kept going in and out. I looked down at the phone and the cord was loose. I held it with my fingers but it still kept going in and out. So I was like ""I'm going to call you back on another phone."" I go to another phone and the same thing happens, the connection keeps fading and I can hardly hear. I did manage to ask again if he would be home around  and he said yes this time. *confusion*. THen the connection went dead again. ARG! I was like ""Does anyone have a cell phone?"" THis one guy did and handed it to me. It was a very small cell phone. I dialed the number but it didn't connect, I looked down at the screen on the phone and I had dialed  instead of . . I realized this and just got frustrated. I went to my mom's house, the cell phone guy in tow. I got on my mom's phone and called him back. THe connection was loud and clear. I was like ""Sorry Kevin not sure whats going on."" We talked a bit more and I confirmed he would be home at , he said he would. THen the connection died again. Once again I was like ""Kevin? Kevin?"" I assumed his other line had run  and he switched over. Suddenly he was back. Then I woke up."
494,"Ok we are at some store. It appears to be pretty dark, maybe night time. I go outside . I walk out the door and go to the right. There are all of these gift baskets you can buy for people except they are huge. There must be like  the one closest to me is the biggest the other  get smaller. I walk to the small one and look at it. I see things in the basket like a chocolate bunny and a bunch of other neat items, then I see a button you can push that will make more items appear in the basket. It's almost as if it's a sample display to show you the different items you can get in each basket, if you pay more you get more. So I hit a button and a bunch of other stuff pops up into the basket, I hit it again and the extra stuff drops back down where you can't see it. I was like coool! I go to the biggest basket  and it must have  price ranges because I hit the button once and some stuff pops up and then I hit it a  time and I see slight movement, but I wasn't sure what popped up. So I hit it again and then change where I am standing. I hit it again and I see that the item was a big  liter bottle of soda. I lose interest and move on to this shelf  that has all these earrings and stuff. I see some small diamond earrings and pick them up. As I bring them closer I realize they are blue and not white. I put them back. Then I see these TINY little diamond earrings and was like OO, cuz they would be the perfect size for my nose ring. As I pick it up I see once again they are blue and instead of one little diamond in each they have now morphed into  little stones, one which fell off while I was holding it, I realize they are just cheap little earrings and put them back. There were some other earrings there as well but I didn't pick any others up. Then I see this this - inch high sculpture of a cat. It's green. I pick it up and I assume it's Jade, because it's heavy, stone like and of course looked like jade. I am very drawn to it. It looked like my old Himalayan cat Mocha. He was sitting down with one leg stretched out licking himself. It was very detailed and intricit. If I were an artist I would be drawing it right now cuz it was so nice! I admired it for a few minutes and then put it down, didn't consider buying it or anything. We then walk back into the store, it was much brighter inside, and they had some glass cabinets with other jewelry in them. My friend Chyrise was with me and we were looking around. I went up to the counter where the lady  was and was looking at the items. I realized they really had very few items in the cabinet. I beleieve I then made a comment about the fact that they must be low on inventory and if we come back next week they will probably be stocked. The lady who worked there said that was right. That's all I remember."
495,"This dream was extremely emotional. And after what happened today  I wonder if it was in someway precognitive. Ok not sure how it all began but in the dream I realized I was pregnant and I was very happy about it. Of course I was already like  months pregnant and had just started going into labor. But it was as if it was all a surprise, like I hadn't known I was pregnant. I remember going to the hospital, my mom came with me. The hospital was somewhat dark and we were in what looked more like an operating room then a patient's room. Somehow it comes up that my mom was also pregant. And I remember thinking, in the dream, that it was amazing see that she is over . I also found it amazing because she wasn't ever able to have children , of course I didn't question it. We also realized she was carrying triplets. Even though I was in labor the nurse came over and started doing an ultrasound on her. I was able to see the ultra sound but it was as if i was looking at my mom's stomach and could see through it versus looking at the screen. It was as if her stomach became the screen. Anyway out of nowhere the doctor says ""Their dead"". I look at my mom and she looks devastated, she started crying and then so did I. I felt a deep sense of loss and sadness and was crying quite heavily . Anyway we get past it and realize I am in labor and that I need to focus on that. I tell her I want to call Chyrise  and let her know what's going on. I pick up the phone and call, it must be around  because I am scared of waking her. Her husband Rick answers, and I ask for her. She gets on the phone and I explain to her I am about to give birth, she is very excited. I get off the phone and really don't remember many more details, except for the fact that I gave birth and the baby was still born, even though it had been alive and kicking a few minutes ago inside me. I once again was devastated and felt extremely sad. That's all I really remember. I do know the singer Avril Levigne also had some significance but not sure how. I remember Chryrise making a comment about her and how beautiful the baby would be."
496," I dreamt that I finally went back to WLFA and was working with Dick Jorgenson, and I had brought my mini disc recorder and all my mini discs. I just threw them in my purse because I didn’t have the lunch bag thing that they gave me any more. And I was going to sit down at the gorge  and edit some stuff I had recorded with him, and so, and also Mom was going to make this soup, and I told her rather than make it before we go and have to wait, why doesn’t she take the stuff over and make it in the little kitchen there and make enough for everybody. So she did. She took the ramen noodles and she took some other vegetables and things, and we went to WLFA and I was there with Dick, and I don’t really remember doing too much editing. But I do remember her making the soup and stuff. "
497," And I also dreamt that I had another song to learn for chorus, and Mom was helping me learn it, and she was like reading the music for me and I would play the notes on the keyboard. And then I would sing them, you know how you do when you’re learning a song and you sight read it. Well, it was pretty different. It had several more octaves and the on-off keys and all like that were to the right instead of to the left. And I dreamt that after we were done – well actually, I dreamt that we kept getting interrupted by phone calls and requests from Dad and people coming over. And we were moving around all over the house. And I was kind of, you know, I don’t know. What the heck?! Finally when we were done, I dreamt that Mom like stashed it away in her work room."
498," And then I dreamt that Dad was one of the people who trained the people on American Dreams. He was really doing a lot of stuff with the City, but I dreamt that he was training these actors and actresses and he was part of the scenery. And I was asking him about what he does, and he didn’t want to tell because he said he’s sworn to secrecy and he doesn’t want the word to get out. And I was thinking, “Man, that’s a show that I really like, and I never knew that my dad was part of it until now?” And let’s see, I know there was something else. And we were taking this walk, and he was kind of telling me something. And we were with Clark and Marylou and a couple other people. And I think I was in a hurry to get home because I knew Mrs. Dougherty was coming over, so then I tell him I’m going to break away from the crowd and I start running. And I’m almost home, and then I woke up. "
499," I was like all keyed up and wired for sound last night when I told that last story. It was like :. I must’ve had too much sugar or something. Well, anyway, last night I had kind of a transient dream, a short, fleeting dream. I dreamt that Mom was sleeping in bed with me, which she used to do a lot, but that she was playing the “La La Loo” tape, and it was okay, I wasn’t scared or anything because I dreamt that the real song that would scare me would be, I think it was, “Stra la la, stra la la,” and some other kind of German or Russian words. That was weird! And when I started thinking of that song, then I started getting a little scared. But then I faded off into some dark transient somewhere and I didn’t remember too much more."
500,"I am at someone's house there appears to be a party. At one point I remember asking if I could use the bathroom and the guy showed me where it was. We walked towards the back of the house and through this door that suddenly became a mall with all these people. He pointed to the bathroom and then went back inside. I get there and there is a HUGE line, I wasn't going to wait so I turned back around. I see these guys going in this small door so I follow them. It's another way back to the house. I remember it being very dark and the ceiling was getting lower to the point where we were crawling. We get up to this wood door. You could see through the gaps in the wood. There was a white wolf standing on the other side of the door. We all got the feeling he was not nice. I remember one guy saying what we had to do to get past the wolf. He was basically saying don't look at it and just walk very slowly. I guess the door opened and I remember us all slowly standing up. We were now in the room the wolf was in, although it was actually outside, the sun was shining, there were trees and big rocks everywhere. One of the guys was standing behind me and we were walking very close together. The wolf seemed to have disappeared but there was now a white pit bull there, we creeped by it until we came up to this small fence which we hopped over. Then we came up to another fence which we hopped over as well. As we hopped over the fence it was we kind of lost our footing and I remember it feeling like we were floating a bit. It was a large rock that we were on and we were very close to the edge. We kind of willed ourselves back to the middle and then landed back on the ground. We get back into the house but then at some point I realize I didn't have on the dress I was wearing . So I figured I left it back somewhere in the room. I head back and this time I come to a door that has like a  foot drop. There is a guy there, kind of like a bouncer. He asks who I am and what I need. I explain I left my dress in there and needed to go get it. I also remember a young child being there. He let me go through and I went back to a door that I thought I had entered  and it wasn't there. Someone else must have been with me but then I ran into this asian lady who had a dress in her hand. She handed it to me and asked if it was mine. I said yes. When I looked at the dress it had weird cartoon figures on it, kinda warped looking. That's all I remember."
501," Last night Mom had this really dumb dream. She dreamt that she was in line to go to the bathroom at like this store or something, and it was really, really crowded and the stalls were really small. And you had to get a CD before you went to sit down on the toilet because you to put the CD in place and pee through the hole. She said that the holes were like, she said that they were CD’s, but they were like as big as ’s. And she had her CD and she was going to her toilet and something was holding onto her leg. And it was this baby rig, and she was going to open the cabinet to see what was in that cabinet – whether it was a real baby or something, but then she woke up. She was too embarrassed to say it herself."
502," Last night I dreamt that I was having a real problem. First I dreamt that I had overslept, and the bus had come too early and it was just going on ahead. And when I tried to look at the time when I thought that the bus was coming, the clock was like going crazy and just crazy stuff like that. I dreamt that I didn’t understand natural logarithms at all, and whenever, and my calculator would act up too, and whenever I would enter in a natural logarithm, it would go, “Error function” and it would do something really screwy. And I think because of that, Elizabeth was trying to get me back into Ms. Forest’s class, who was my teacher last year, first semester. She wanted me to just be there while Ms. Forrest was reviewing something. But in order to be in Ms. Forrest’s class I had to skip Ms. Larson’s class. That was just a dumb dream about math!"
503,"Ok, first part of this dream. I want to begin publishing a Science Magazine, similar to like Discover. I was going to offer it for free but then realized that I still had to make money to pay for it. I saw this magazine sitting there and picked it up. I showed my mom. The paper they used for the pages was very high stock and thick. I explained I wouldn't have to use paper quite that nice. Then I flipped to the first page and it was a  page layout for an add for Dell Computers. Then it dawned on me, I can sell ads in my magazine and make money that way. Now I am at my mom's house and some friend had stayed over too. I was sleeping and I woke up and looked at the click. It was  am. I thought to myself, a bit hazy because I had just woken up, that I was going to be late for work. Once I realized I had to be there in  minutes I got up really fast. I grabbed my clothes and some marijuana. When we walked downstairs it was very warm and humid, I could actually feel it in my dream. I looked at something similar to my weather bug program  and it said it was  degrees out. We got in the care and headed to work, I think I lit up in the car.  As I was driving this maroon car in the lane next to me got very close to my car. It was almost touching us. I was honking at them so they wouldn't hit us. Finally we are driivng along and I realized, ew, I didn't brush my teeth or put on any deoderant. I told my friend I had to turn around and go home for a few minutes, she seemed ok with it. We get back home aNd I run inside. I run upstairs and brush my teeth, my friend was there too. Then I put on some deoderant, it was the stick kind and a piece of it broke off and fell on the floor. We walked back downstairs and my mom was there. She thought we had just gotten home after partying all night. I was like no, we were here all night, woke up late, started to work and realized we had to come back. I had the feeling she thought I was lying. I grabbed something to eat and we left for work. It was a big sub sandwich. As we are driving I mention that I didn't bring anything for lunch and I would be hungry. Then I realized, ""wait"" I'm eating this big ass sub sandwich I should be fine. That's all I remember."
504," Last night I dreamt that I was gearing up for my graduation party and Dad was setting up this salad bar that kind of reminded me of a sound board because the salad went in the place that the faders went. Okay, anyway, we had this salad bar set up and it was kind of, I don’t know why it put me to mind to a sound board except it had faders on the front, and the salad went where all the rest of the pots would normally go. And Dad was trying to get me to do a mathematical problem to see if people would get more salad if they divided it up evenly, or if people just went up there and just got however much they wanted. That was kind of dumb. I know there was more to it. Lately I’ve been real bad about not putting my dreams on the tape when I first wake up because that’s the best time. I say, “Oh, I’ll do it when I wake up more and my voice sounds a little better,” but then I forget and then it’s like blah. So even if I sound half asleep, I should do it and capture everything I can, and I’ll wake up as I go."
505," Last night I dreamt that we were in this, a trip that we were in Iraq or Afghanistan or someplace like that. And we were at this park that had trees that were all painted by the people. The people painted churches and farms and trees and stuff all over these trees. And I was climbing on these trees, and there were these ducks and seagulls, and it seems nobody ever fed them because they were so hungry. And these pigeons were just so tame. One just sat on my shoulder the whole time until I could get him some bread. And there was this bird bread I was giving them and they were just all over me. And then I dreamt that we got back in the car and we went to this beach. I think Sheryl, Sandra and Sam were there, but I’m not sure. I do remember, however, that I had to sing at this beach for some reason, and I was trying to figure out how was my voice going to be able to soar above the roar of the sea. And I also remember I had a machine like they have at Tropicana Fields for editing in the car, and I was real quickly trying to edit some accompaniment. That was crazy, man. "
506,"The alarm woke me up, I hit snooze and had a quick dream during the  minutes. lol All I basically remember is being in this house. I believe it had a wood floor. I was in the front room and when I looked out the window I could see the ocean, it appeared very close. I opened the door and the water was coming right up to the house. I couldn't see any ground, all I could see was water. I felt a bit uneasy. "
507," Last night I had a dream that I was writing a letter to President Bush about how “Blue Bird” scared me when I was younger and how there was a story that I imagined to be true in my dream that I wrote in the letter, but now that I’m awake, I know that it’s not. And Mrs. Lake’s kindergarten class, I dreamt that she used to play it and I used to get all up in arms, but she didn’t. That was something else. But anyway, I was writing all this to President Bush. I don’t know why I thought he’d care. I guess, I don’t know. I started on a postcard and I transferred onto a piece of notebook paper. Dumb me – I should have done the whole thing on the notebook paper. That’s all I can remember."
508," Last night I had a dream that I was at some kind of a religeous convention with Sandra and Lee, and to do all these things, we had this great big room, in Orlando or Tampa or something. And then we came home and everybody was home, and it was getting close to Easter and I was getting all these Easter presents. I got this ______ bunny that was supposed to hop around with a remote control, and a bunch of other Easter candy. And somehow I had the notion that I was on this really long trip and now I was home, and I was getting all this stuff. And I was playing this song that, “Ain’t It Good to Be Back Home Again.” And I think part of was maybe Mom was home, and Sheryl, Sandra and Sam were all there. I can’t remember any more. I’m getting bad about that lately."
509," Last night I dreamt that, had this dream that I was getting picked up from school at : o’clock, and I had to talk to Dad, but the radio was on in the car and he turned it down, and I was missing the Friday festivities because he was talking to me. And I dreamt that we had to go to this bus travel seminar March , and then I dreamt that  I had attended a bus thing at school and the internship ladies were reading like these dumb little things that you had to answer yes or no on your application. And then I dreamt that me and some other girl were singing in the living room to this Christmas music. We were trying to put “Away In a Manger” to a rap beat! And my voice was like the only voice that couldn’t be heard. I couldn’t sing out for some reason, I don’t know why. It was like I couldn’t sing out. And after that I woke up."
510,"Ok last night before bed I was looking at some photos and a video my friend shot, she lives in SD. I was in San Diego and I believe I was staying with my friend Chris. I was just there for a visit, scoping out where I might want to move. Shawn, Chris' friend was there. I really don't remember specifics except for the fact that we kissed. It was a really long kiss, then he said something to the affect that it didn't mean anything because he had a girlfriend. I seemed ok with that. LOL I decide to go to bed and there are all these babies in the bed. They each had their own little spot to sleep and I was sleeping in the middle. I was concerned about rolling over on one of them. "
511,"Ok I don't remember all of this dream. But towards the end I am at my mom's house and I believe she is holding me captive there. I remember feeling very angry and stressed. I was downstairs and Albert Einstein was there too. I told him I needed to go upstairs and get some of my things so I could escape. He took my hand and we walked up the stairs. We peeked in the bedroom my mom was in, and she was asleep. We snuck by and went into my bedroom and shut the door. I started grabbing stuff and putting it in a bag as well as a suitcase. He was helping me. Then we found a baby and it started to cry. Albert went to open the bedroom door and I told him not to because the baby would wake up my mom. Finally we grabbed all my stuff and snuck back downstairs. Then I woke up."
512," Last night I dreams that I was at the house with – I can’t remember how or why – but I was watching “American Idol” and there was this girl in blue singing “Nights in White Satin” and she was like on the stage. And you know how they do – the pick the singer up on a cable and they wing them around over the audience? Well, that’s what they were doing, but they winged her, they lifted her all the way up to the mezzanine of this auditorium where there was this huge knight statue with big arms, and just let her hang in front of this knight for a while, and she was still singing. I can’t imagine how somebody can sing being hung from a thing like that. They must have the words already and lip sync it because you just can’t sing unless you’re on your two feet. And I remember Sam called during the show to say that he was close by and that they were all going to be in town. And I was a little irritated because they never get to watch this show really and here they’re almost there, and there’s the phone call. But it was okay, I guess, and then they all came and we went up in the tree house and we were climbing trees, and then I woke up."
513," This is the next day. Last night I had the dream that I just told, and this evening American Idol was on, and it was a Tuesday when they have all the performers do their thing. Well, anyway, that was on, and I was thinking, “Yahoo, I’m home for the night. I don’t have to go anywhere or do anything. I don’t have to have anybody record it.” And I’m sitting there watching it and Sam calls. And it’s like the same thing that happened in my dream except nobody sang “Nights in White Satin” and was suspended over the audience. Now last night – this is November  – nah, what the heck am I thinking? "
514," Last night I had a stupid dream. I dreamt that I was babysitting Mrs. Layton’s son, and his name was Tweetie, and he was like a five-year-old and I thought nothing of it. And we were supposed to drive him somewhere and she wanted us to drive him in their car because Tweetie felt more comfortable in it, she said. And the make of her car was a Tweetie. And it was this minivan like type thing and it had real complicated circuitry, secondary circuits in it. You had to like insert your key and do a special little thing to move the seats forward and back, which was what she did for Mom. And we were going through this drive-through Happy Meal fast food place, and we were just sitting and sitting and sitting. This line took forever. And while we were sitting Mom was kind of doing some messing around in the front and I was sitting with Tweetie in the back. And Mom said that the radio in Mrs. Layton’s Tweetie car, just like it is in ours. And that’s all I can remember."
515,"Ok I was at this ski lodge, I am assuming it was at least. There was this really cute baby about a year old, dark hair and eyes, looked hispanic . So this little baby was sick and some blonde girl recommended some specific medicine. Then I mentioned that the baby had asthma, although she wasn't currently weasing. Then I put my hand on her chest and felt it rattling and said ""oh she is weasing"". I said that there was asthma medication at my house and I volunteered to take the baby, not sure whose it was. So I put the baby in a chair and leave it there and go outside . I went outside and there was a group of people. It was a ski resort and there was snow all around. It was night time although the place was well lit. I over heard one guy tell another guy they should go to switzerland, as if it were close by. Then he mentioned they should go to some other place staring with a C. It was this hill near by. So I decided to check it out. I am standing atop this hill. It's snow covered. I decide to lay down on my stomach and slide down it. I start down the hill and feel the sensation of sliding down. As I get to the bottom there is this huge puddle of mud, lovely. Although I don't remember getting dirty. Some guy had followed me and slid down too. We were both laughing and raced back up the hill, I barely beat him. Then someone tugs my arm. It was Shawn Cook, someone I used to go to church with. He walked back to the lodge with me, because I mentioned I had to get the baby. When we walked in the baby was on the floor. Then I remember hearing someone say the baby fell out of the chair. I played it off and said something to the effect that I didn't know where the person I left the baby with was, even though I didn't leave the baby with anyone. A woman was sitting on the ground with the baby as we got closer. I took the baby and headed home. I got home and baby was now my old cat Rosco. I was trying to find this special food that he had to eat for his med. I also had a pill I was supposed to give him but wasn't sure how. Someone comes in so I rushed to get dressed. Then I go outside and my dad is there . He was there and he had all these cakes. There were other people with him. There was this huge chocolate frosted chocolate cupcake that I was eyeing so I took it. Yum. There were all these other mini cakes one was white with cocoa powder on top and some others. We were all sitting down eating. Then I see my pastor drive up at the gas station. I was just sitting there looking at him, secretly hoping he would love over and notice me. He didn't. So I yelled out ""Mr. Mills"" . He looked over as I ""drove"" off. I went back to the house and then the people I had been with followed. This one girl came in and I asked if he  had followed her, she said no. She told me that he had come up to them and said ""I don't know you people"" quite rudely and then walked off. Then I remember I was writing something, and thinking  that maybe I should go back to christianity, back to the church because I liked the way it felt when I was there. I liked the unity and the feeling of belonging. . I go back outside and the cake eating party is still going on. I notice this small square chocolate cake. It was in a plastic container. My friend Dee Dee from highschool was sitting in front of it. I asked her what it was and she said something, don't remember. I asked her if it was anything like flan and she said no. Suddenly my pastors wife shows up. She said that she told him  that it had been me who said his name. I asked her if i had ever explained to her why I never came back to the church. She said yes, but then I said but did I REALLY tell you the truth? Then something distracted her and I was trying to get her attention. Then I woke up."
516,"Ok I remember I was going to the Grammy awards. I was at my mom's house, although it wasn't her house, and I was going through the closet to find something to wear. I found this outfit that I can still picture. It had an asian influence. It was made of silk, a bit shiny although not tacky shiny. The shirt was VERY long and went down to about the knees and then it had pants as well. It was a dark blue/purple color and had some asian designs on it. Then I was at some other place I guess waiting to go to the show. There was this black guy there who I knew, I think he was a musician. I don't remember much else about the dream, because I waited too long to write the damn thing down. LOL"
517,"Ok I had this one in the middle of the night, and then woke up. I committed it to memory and then when I woke up this morning I couldn't remember it. But about an hour later it came back to me, at least pieces of it did. I really should have gotten up at the time of the dream and written it down, because it was quite intense and i remembered the details at that time. Now most of them are gone. Ok I know I was in my condo and my friend Mike  was living with me. I believe I was trying to sell it  but there were  people out to keep me from doing that. They were trying to find a reason to get me evicted. One was a woman with long black hair  and the other was a man. I never actually speak to them in the dream just see them a few times. Part of the dream involved a dog or a puppy, but don't remember any specifics other then seeing it out the window of my condo. Also at one point I remember some kids being outside my window as well, not sure what they were doing. Sad but thats all I remember, there was so much more to it."
518,"Wow this was a vivid one. Ok there was more to it then this but I will go with what I can remember. I am at my job or some kind of job. There is also a McDonald's in our job. I am sitting working on my computer, as people keep walking by to order food. One guy orders this crazy sounding burger . I get hungry and go up there. I see the Z burger and it's absolutely huge so I was like no way that's too big. I wanted a bacon cheeze burger. There was bacon lying in this bin so I said that I would like bacon on the burger but that I want these strips  not these , she said ok. Then I was like, hmm I just ate and am not really hungry I think I will order in a little while, instead. So now I am back at my computer, I notice that my computer desktop is displaying on someone elses monitor. I see a game of tetris running and realize I had left it on. I quickly turn off the game so I don't get in trouble. Now I am still at work and I'm in this room where people are playing basket ball or something. I am watching the ball intently. Then I go sit down with these  girls, they are really nice and we are all talking. One of them starts talking about stock, and that she had bought stock in Coca-Cola. Then she turns on the radio so she can hear the stock report. I remember hearing it clearly, and everyone else in the room seemed to be getting upset because it was too loud so she turned it down. We talked some more, although I don't remember about what. Then this fashion show started and these people walked out in some interesting outfits. This one black man came out and he had on this black shirt and pants but he had on HUGE wooden shows the kind the dutch used to wear, that look like they would hurt like hell. However his were extraordinarily big, probably about  foot high and  feet long, we were all laughing, it was obvious he did it as a joke, it looked really funny. At this point I awoke slightly and immediately tried to keep the images in my head, I must have succeeded because I fell right back into the dream. Now I am back in the room where my desk is, my boss is in there and she did something to really piss me off. So I walked out, she seemed shocked that I would do that. Once I get outside I realize I am across the street from my mom's house. I bend down and put the cigarette I was smoking, out in a puddle. . As I get across the street I see my brother. He is doing these different handstand positions on a chair. It looked like some interesting asian type of martial arts thing. I stood there and watched him do a few different positions. Then he noticed me. I said something to the affect that I hadn't seen him in over a month . I said I would love a hug, and he said no. This was devastating to me and I felt extremelly hurt. I began to cry and I pushed him aside and said ""Fine, this day couldn't get any worse."" and began to walk towards the house. At which point he grabbed me and hugged me. It felt so nice to hug him, I really miss him and that obviously carried over into the dream. As I walk towards the house I look down and there are some papers and folders and I get the impression that they were from a class my brother was taking, he was going back to school, I was happy about that. I get into the house and go upstairs. There are people walking through the house but I didn't think anything of it. The house was laid out differently then it really is. I go into the bathroom which faced the front of the house and I was able to see my brother still doing his martial arts thing from the window. I get ready to get into the shower and suddenly the bathroom door opens. Standing before me are actors Joe Pesci  and Joe Pantoliano. Joe Pesci was behind Joe Pantoliano and he was just staring at me like ""what is she doing here"". Joe Pantoliano began talking to me. I had a feeling they were there to rob the house. Although in the dream they weren't the actors it was more as if they were playing characters. Then I woke up."
519,"Ok first dream I am with my mom and there is this very pretty black female she looks kinda like Ashanti. Anyway some how I was able to switch bodies with her. I seemed unconcerned about the fact that she was in my body. I knew it was just a temporary thing. I was so excited and was telling my mom ""this proves we have a soul, I couldn't have done this otherwise"". Then we went over to this couple's house for dinner. My mom introduced me as a friend of hers. The husband was eyeing me as we walked in because I looked so damn good. lol Then I remember I was back as myself and I wanted to do it again. I laid down and the black female was laying down across the room, I closed my eyes and concentrated and then felt something. However, this time she has switched bodies with my mom. That's all I remember."
520,"I was at some kind of retreat, my canadian friend Mike was there too. I was chillin in my bedroom and he walked in. He handed me this bag of weed. I took it from him and looked at it but couldn't see it clearly, I brought it up closer and it looked great all green with red hair, no seeds. And it was at least an ounce . He told me to hang onto it we could smoke some later. Then we laid down in the bed, I realized the door was open so I shut it and hopped back in. We just laid there and snuggled it was very nice. Now at this retreat they are going to pick a team to compete in some kind of sport, it was similar to soccer. Someone had announced that they would announce the team at dinner. I go downstairs and the room where dinner is going to be held is closed off because they are meeting about the game. I thought that was odd. There was this little kid standing there so I picked him up and started spinning around, he seemed to enjoy it. Then Mike comes up to me and said he was on the team and because of that we wouldn't be able to spend the next  nights together because they would be out promoting the game. That sounded very odd to me, and I was a little frustrated by that, we came to this thing to be together and now he was going to be all involved in this game. I was even more frustrated to find out they have picked no females to play, what the fuck was up with that? Now I am outside talking to Mike and saying that this retreat is a bit too religious for me and I was really pissed off about the whole game thing, just felt like going home. Some other guy heard us and came over. Mike and I both noticed his shirt, it looked like it was text from an online discussion board. I said it reminded me of ""UBB"". That's a unix based forum that a lot of people use. We all talked for a minute but I don't remember the specifics. I was like fine whatever, and I went up stairs. I got the weed out and rolled  joints. Then I found that there was an  of coke in the bag too. So I cut a little piece off and chopped it up and sprinkled it on the joints. Then I put the bag of weed in my pocket and the coke in my purse along with the joints. I remember feeling a bit nervous that I would get caught with it. I also wanted to find someone to go smoke it with but really didn't know anyone but mike. I went downstairs to get something to eat and most people were already eating. I see this piece of paper and pick it up. It had peoples names on it with chores. I remember seeing my name and something about a place we were going to go boating at. It has some things that I was going to have to do. I was like ""fuck this"" I am not here to be told to do chores like I'm some fucking  year old. Those were my exact thoughts in the dream, I was pissed and ready to leave. I go into the dining room, they were serving tacos. I go to the table and there are these soft tortillas on the table I pick to up and then go down the line. I ask for chicken and she puts only a little chicken on each one, cheap fuckers. Then I put some sour cream and cheese on them and nothing else. I walk over to the window and I see the guys practicing for the game, but I don't see mike anywhere. I really wanted to go home but didn't want to leave Mike, I felt very conflicted. Then I woke up."
521," I had a kind of bizarre dream last night. I dreamt that I had my mixer, my calculator, my CD player, a little audio system and stuff set up at the kitchen table. We were doing math and I was kind of doing sound stuff too. And the mixer had its faders like it does, and it had this panel of numbers off to the side that you could use as a calculator too. And the bizarrest part is the back of the mixer, there was this cap and you would uncap the cap and there would be this really, really, really sharp, sharp blade that kind of spins around and you would put a CD in and it would play it, but it would chop it all up. And when I took it out, I just touched it and I cut myself, and then we were kind of doing math and stuff. Then I dreamt that we were going to see Mrs. Gresham in the hospital, and we went up the elevator and we were going around, and then I realized that it wasn’t a hospital; it was a hotel and we had a room there. Mom and I were on a trip. And we went to this little restaurant on the beach, and we were there ordering our food and we asked the waitress if she would get the bill people to unload our stuff from the car.  Then we were swimming in the water and like looking for fish and looking for sharks and stuff. And then I was back at the kitchen table with my mixer and stuff, and oh, one other thing to this dream – I dreamt that I was supposed to go to Brittany’s house that day, and I had recorded a concert on the VCR to take the tape over to her. But I also had drawn these pictures that I had taken pictures of with the camera, and then I was going to animate and make them move and do things and stuff. It was kind of weird; well, it was neat."
522," … important part to this dream that I can remember now. Just before I woke up, I was in my studio doing something, I don’t know what. I think I had picked up my equipment from the kitchen table and I was putting it back where it’s supposed to go, and I had DP fired up. I was getting ready to do something. And Dad came up and he was looking around and stuff, and he asked me, “If you had a keyboard, where would you plug it into your mixer?” And I explained to him that I would plug it into the tape input because the tape input was hardly every used for anything and the CD input was always being used. And I explained that I wouldn’t plug it into a mike input because the signal was in stereo. But now that I’m awake and I’m conscious, I doubt that. I don’t know if the signal was in mono or stereo. I’ve seen it recorded in stereo before, but I have a hunch that it’s mono, so in that case I would plug it into the quarter inch part of a mike input. That was just kind of, I don’t know, weird."
523,"Ok I was on some website not sure if it was like a dating service type of website. I remember seeing an ad for this guy, next thing I know he is at my house. He looks either hispanic or middle eastern, he looked a bit creepy. He started tampering with my computer and I told him not to do that. Then suddenly I see the wall behind me moving. He was squeezing in between the oven and the wall  but the wall was like rubber and moved I could see the indent of his body. I was like ""what the fuck"". I ask him what he's doing and he makes a comment like ""don't tell me what I can and can't do"" . I suddenly felt very uneasy. Next thing I know he has a knife and is coming at me. We struggle and I get the knife from him. I stab him several times although he doesn't scream or anything. Finally he leaves. I call the police. Then we go back online to find his ad to see if we can track down who he is. At first I can't find it but then I realize I wasn't logged in, so I log in and we find the ad. I suggest to the cops that we set up a sting operation and I would dress up as some other female and be the bait, they think it's a good idea. That's all I remember about that one."
524,"Ok I was on some kinda cruise ship. I go into my room and it's basically this really long room. When I enter I see this container of what look like small matresses, although they look too small to sleep on. I look down towards the end of the room  and I see some boxes of food all over the place. I walk over and look at it. Then I see some candy . They were packages that had different candy all wrapped together like Twix and Reese's and Snikers, yum. I pocket on of them. Then the ship is ready to depart. My room now must be at the very front of the ship because I can see out the room and see everything in front of the ship. I lay down and suddenly the ship shoots out of where it is, kinda up into the air. It flips over completely and then lands right side up in the water. I felt the sensation of flipping over it was awesome. I wasn't really scared. Then we take a nose dive straight down into the water. Since I am in the front of the ship I see the water come up over the windows. I am stuck because the gravity is keeping me down near the window. Water starts coming in and covers my face and I am concerned about not being able to breathe. I don't remember much more about that portion. Now I am back on the ship with some friends and we are getting ready to depart again. I warn them about the crazy ride away but this time it just sets sail like normal and nothing happens. That's all I remember."
525,"Ok I don't have a complete handle on this dream but basically there was a kid that was killed and we knew who was responsible but the person was not brought to justice. I was furious about this and was contacting the police to try to find out why nothing had been done. I got no assitance and figured I would just have to take care of it myself, although I don't know how. At one point in the dream I remember observing this guy and girl in their living room discussing it all. Then I am in this office and I guess I work for a car company selling cars. These  guys are in there and they want to buy a truck, I have to make sure their credit is approved first. I send over their application but I send it over for  trucks instead of . I tell the guys that I put it through for  just to see what would happen, they don't seem to mind although they still only plan on buying . Immediately a fax comes back and I tell them they were approved. That's all I remember."
526,"I am in the car with my mom, dad and I think someone else. We are driving over the Woodrow Wilson Bridge from Maryland into Virginia. I look up and the sun, oh my god it was incredible. It was at LEAST  times it's normal size and had little black spots all over it. I was mesmorized by it as was everyone in the car. Then suddenly this small blue car in front of us crashed. I screamed for my mom to watch out and she just missed hitting him. I noticed a cop was back behind us so he probably saw the crash, but I wondered if I should call the police and let them know. I remember saying that there is now way that poor guy lived as I looked back and saw his car face down and crunched up in a ditch."
527," I don’t think this will, but let’s see if this fits on this tape. First I dreamt that I was at the Dome with Elizabeth and I was looking for Frederick’s office and I was going up these stairs and we had to go up the stairs in the dark. And I was like totally making sure that I did not lose my balance. I was like crawling on my knees going up these stairs. And I had to go up to the fourth floor and there was like nothing on the fourth floor. So I came down to the third floor and then I got on the elevator and went up to the fourth floor, and which I found their offices. And I went in the office door and I looked around and I didn’t see anybody I knew. So I turned around and I came out and I went out into a parking lot and I went back to school with Elizabeth and Mom and Dad were waiting there. They said that they had been waiting there for about two hours and they were having a little tift about where I was. And they had been sitting there like having a picnic, and then we all got in the car and we came home. And I had this like – I don’t know what you want to call it – this like walking, talking stuffed animal that I had to test. It was like a furbie except it had a man’s face for the devil race for some odd reason. And I was getting ready to test it and I also dreamt that, you know how my PDA thing, I go to the clock mode and it gives me the time if I double-click the __?__key? "
528," Well, I dreamt in my dream that first of all the clock on my alarm radio was totally whacking out. It was like light and there was like no numbers in it. And then I go to hear the time on the parrot thing, and I go to the clock and I double-click the side key and it gives me this commercial. And I’m like, “What!!?” And so I open the door and I go over to the next thing, which gives me another one. And I also dreamt that I had Big Bird back. And then I dreamt that I was like sitting there and I have my two sets of pillows, right? Well, between those two sets of pillows I dreamt that I had everything under the sun, like five tapes and my machine here that I remembered leaving, an Easter egg, actually two Easter eggs, a potted plant that had tipped over and several other odd things like an empty spray bottle and stuff. Now that was whacked, man! "
529," Last night I had kind of a crazy dream. This is all I can remember of it though. I was on this boat and it was kind of like a big sailing ship, and I was kind of stepping out on deck with this musician type of guy who was playing the guitar. And he had a guitar amp sitting on board. And he was playing some big easy bayou stuff and I was dancing and singing with him. And we were just having a blast. And then I was walking around the deck and looking down into the water, and I saw it really black along the edges. And then this man got real serious and I realized that he was Dad, and we had to, he said that the wind was dying down and he was going to have to turn on the motor for ______, and all of a sudden I realized that we were in a real small boat, and I sort of jumped down and started swimming. And I realized that there were these big shells and these chocolate chips on the bottom of the ocean, and I was having a chocolate chips of the sea snack. And then I was swimming because I didn’t want to be there when the motor started, and I realized that they were five feet behind me now, and I woke up."
530," Last night I had a really crazy dream. I dreamt that Sandra was in town and it was kind of close to my graduation, and I had a Josie Wileski  CD that was kind of like the one she had. And now here’s the crazy part. We were at this racetrack because we were going to watch the Grand Prix or a Festival of States parade; I can’t remember which, but probably both. We were staying in this little hotel that had a view of the track, and there was this guy who was probably a veteran. He organized veteran parades that were little things that took ten minutes, and they ran by like every hour. And when they ran by, there was these rescue trucks with these sirens. Some made the standard warble sound, some made the back-up alarm sound, like that interval, and some just made a plain wail sound. And all these going by. Some honked their horns, some didn’t. It made a big ruckus and it scared me really bad. And I was laying down in the bed at the hotel and I think Mom was there doing something, and I hear this and it was like totally commotiony. And then we were down there before the actual Festival of States parade was going to take place, and Sandra was there and Mom. I think Dad was there, but he was off helping one of the rescue guys. But anyway, there was this extra long parade by this veteran guy before the actual Festive of States parade started, and I figured, “Ooh, boy, I’d better get myself out of here.” And so I said I had to use the bathroom, and I went into the hotel’s bathroom and I was sitting there and sitting there and sitting there on the toilet, listening to these girls trying on clown dresses and commenting on how they looked. And I faintly, faintly heard all the sirens and rockets in the background, but I wasn’t there. And before I said I had to use the bathroom, I was like sitting there on the blanket holding onto Sandra."
531," Last night I had this really stupid dream that I had to take an FCAT test. I’m a senior now, so I don’t have to take it, but there’s been a lot of hullabaloo around school caused by it. So then that I had to take the FCAT test, I could take it home and take as long as I wanted, and I had the notion, and I had this notion that I could go to this website and get all the answers and cheat on it. I was going to do this in my studio and go online with the MAC and so this while I was listening to some kind of CD and just take forever and do this test and get it all right. And I can’t remember, I think I kept wanting to sit down and get this started, and there was just so much other stuff I kept getting interrupted. And that’s it. "
532,"Ok this dream made perfect sense because I had to be out of the house this morning by  because my realtor was coming. I am in my house  and there were other people there as well who had spent the night. I remember waking up and realizing we were all running late. I was frantic telling everyone to hurry the hell up because we had to get out before the realtor came. I was yelling at everyone because they were taking their time. I don't remember too many details. Finally we all get out of the house and we are about to get into a truck to leave and these girls walk up and start talking. Everyone is just standing their chatting away. Finally I was like ""WHAT THE FUCK!!! Would you GET THE FUCK IN THE TRUCK we GOTTA GO!!!!!"". With that everyone got in the truck and we left."
533,"Ok first I am in this game. In real life I play this space action game called Cosmic Rift, however in this case it was as if I was in the game, although it was still a game, it's not like I could get hurt or shot down, but I was actually flying the ship etc. At one point there were some new ships introduced, I hopped in one to try it out. We must have been in this huge room, it was all black to depict space. I remember going after this one ship and using a new weapon that I had won, by getting an extra level. I also felt the sensation of flying VERY fast. I can't quite describe what this whole scene was really like but it was quite cool. After I was done playing I am down on the ground, still in the same room I think. It's like I am in some sort of pit because I have to climb up to get out of the room. Next part I am in a bedroom chillin with my brother, Lawrence Fishburne and a few other people. We were all just hanging out. I mentioned I had some weed in my car. I walk out to my car and suddenly this very tall ominous looking man walks up to me. He sticks a gun in my stomach and looks at me. I had a very bad feeling that he was going to shoot me and then he pulled the gun away and started walking to where my brother and everyone was. I was like ""oh shit he's going to shoot one of them"". I get back and turns out he hadn't shot them. Then we look out the window and we see all these people with guns like they were taking over the area. In the distance I also telepatically observe this truck of security guards. In the truck the real security guards are tied up, and the guys driving the truck were pretending to be the guards. I wasn't sure what their plan was but it was as if they were invading the area we were in. We all decide we should leave. I remember my brother went a different way then I did, which upset me because I didn't want him to die. Myself and one other person were walking up this hill, we tried to be inconspicuous but someone saw us and caught us. Next thing you know we were in some house and we were tied up and had all these probes on our head. There was an asian man there and he pressed a button and i felt all this electricity go through me. We knew he was going to kill us. He had a very sharp pair of scissors in his hand. He had bent over to do something and the guy I was with wanted to try to kick him so we could escape but for some reason changed him mind. Now we are outside on the porch and the asian guy was now a hispanic woman. We were still her captures. About  blocks away, through a traffic light there is a gas station. I see some truck pull up there. I guess she turned her head or got distracted so we ran. We get up to the intersection and I walk out in front of the cars sticking my hand out so they will stop, came very close to getting hit a few times, and we make it across to the gas station. I think about where my brother could be and hope he is ok. I walk to the drivers side of this truck . There was a man and his son, they were getting gas but it was obvious they were trying to escape too. I ask if we can go with him and he says yes. Then I woke up. "
534," Last night I had a semi-scary dream. First of all I dreamt that I was reading this long epic poem, kind of like the, it was written in the style of the Odyssey, except it was only about an eighth of the length. It was the story in epic poem fashion, and it was about this lady who saw a monster in her swimming pool and it tried to drown her, and from then she was extremely scared of monsters, and what she did and all. And I think one of the lines went something like, “One time I had this,” I mean, at one point I had this picture in my head of a lady sitting in the bathtub, leaning over the edge and doing some sewing. And the poem read for those lines, “And the monster of the water came up and bit off a piece of her head.” And that was real weird, and she was like freaking out because she was so scared of this monster. And I can remember that I kind of like, they were talking about the monster of the water all through this poem, but the last line said something about the monster of Oof. That was weird. And I dreamt that I actually saw the monster in the swimming pool, and I jumped in the swimming pool, for whatever reason. And there was ice around the pool there and it was shallow for a swimming pool. And there was this big guy who was like running around and trying to drown me, but I’m a good, strong swimmer and I got away from him. And then I dreamt that I tried to get out of the bus without my cane and stuff, and I didn’t know what the heck bus I was really on, and I didn’t have my go card  and it was just a bad deal. And then I woke up."
535," Last night I dreamt that Dad was sick and dying, and first of all I came home from a long trip and everybody was saying that he was dead. Then I realized that he was still alive; he was just real sick. And he was home from the hospital for a while and he was laying in our bed, and he seemed to just want to be by himself. We were all eating this cereal from this triangular box. There were all these family coming into town, and I really didn’t want to see them. I just wanted to be alone. And let’s see what else. When I woke up, I actually had to wipe real tears from my eyes. I don’t remember too much more."
536,I don't remember specifics about this dream except I must have had a sunburn and it was peeling. So I was taking the peeling peices of skin and pulling them off my arm. I was trying to see how big of a peice I could pull off before it would break. Then I noticed my was also peeling and began picking that skin off as well. gross.
537," Last night I had kind of an absurd dream. I dreamt that there were these people coming over and we were at this friend’s house up in Largo, I guess. And I was walking around upstairs in these people’s house, and walking back and forth on this point. There were some Christmas decorations, display figures, up there, and I was talking to, oh no, I was looking down at all the people coming in and I thought I would go down and say hi, so I did. And the next thing I knew, we were in a boat, or we were getting ready to go on a boat with some of the people, and the engine wouldn’t start and I was sitting there on the boat with a boom box. The engine wouldn’t start and there was this certain tour boat starter thing that made a lot of noise that would start the engine, but first I wanted to get off the boat and go walk around on this little island in the main group while they were doing that. And so I got Mom to take care of the boom box, and I got up and I guess at that moment I woke up."
538,"Ok I was at some place, walking down the hall. I decided  I would take my invisibility potion and go out and cause some havoc. I took some and then this girl Ellen came walking down the hall. I did something to her and it freaked her out. Then she started chasing me, I guess she could see me now. She was really mad at me and I apologized to her a few times. I felt extremely bad and started crying. *rolls eyes* . Then I pull her into this room to talk to her and all these other people come in and sit me down, like they're gonna lecture me or something, I felt like a kid. Ick!"
539," I had a pretty odd dream last night. I dreamt that in English we were reading in our literature book and we were reading this story about this man who was like obsessed. And he was obsessed with people knowing where they are and people feeling safe, but yet he did these things that really wouldn’t make them, or really wouldn’t make me feel any safer, like, for example, he wanted to put a little alarm thing that kind of sounded like back-up alarms near people’s houses so that they would always know where they are. Well, for me that would be just awful. And he wanted to wait until they were sleeping so they couldn’t say anything, and he needed a cool, breezy night to do it. And I think what he was going to do was tap into their plumbing pipes and stick it in lines and that when they turn on their water, the water would go through and activate it. And then he was also wanting to put them in elevators so that if people get stuck, they could make enough racket and be heard. Well, and then we finished the story, and we were starting to look at it and questions. Oh, and I walked out of English class with this girl named Marilla who I have, that sits next to me with my internship seminars. But here she was in my English class and I walked out with her. We were going down the stairs and there, set up on the landing of the stairwell, was a little sound booth, recording studio-like type thing. And Elizabeth and this boy sat down and they were listening to this tape of this band that was playing, and the monitors were facing us because there were microphones and they didn’t want them to fade. And I went over there and sometimes I have a bad habit of using – not necessarily a bad habit, but I have a habit of using two fingers to move faders instead of one, because when I want to move them in small increments I just two fingers. I went over there and I adjusted some of the faders and Elizabeth kind of was surprised at my two finger grip and she said, “Why don’t you just use one finger?” And I was like, “Because two fingers is more precise for me.” And about that time I woke up."
540," Last night I dreamt that my graduation party was in a week already, and that I was in there kind of inspecting and looking around to see how the tables and stuff were. And they had made up a long head table, but it didn’t seem they had put any table cloth on it yet, and it was this blue table that could seat three. And then they intermixed ittle square tables that can seat four. They put a blue one and two yellow ones together. So as a total, it could seat eight people. Well I thought that we could get more chairs if we took the yellow table and moved it over to the side, and we put Sam and Nikki and Bart and Steve over there, and then we could seat – one, two, three, four, five, six – we could seat six at our little table that we had joined and then we could have a total of ten seats. That was kind of odd. And then we went up to this, oh, and in this ballroom they had like couches around the perimeter for some reason. And then in the, we were up at the counter and they gave us our, all the food for the buffet to take home so that we could keep it cold. That was strange."
541," Last night I had kind of a bizarre dream. I dreamt that we were looking in somebody’s fundraiser catalog and there was all this kind of junky, expensive stuff. And but there was this one thing – there was this Easter bunny, there was this karaoke Easter bunny that sang popular songs and I just thought that was the coolest thing, so we had to get it. But we had to order it online, so we went to this crazy website and we finally found it, and we ordered it. And then, then another dream, I guess, but it seemed contiguous to me. All of a sudden we were going to meet the chorus at Countryside High for that competition thing, and we were sitting in a car for whatever reason, and we were almost late. And there was another school parading past us. We didn’t want to jump in their line and screw up their order. So we waited until they went by and then we raced up to our warm up room to find out that I didn’t have my black shoes. I had my white shoes. And Mom was saying that Josie probably had some. I had the notion that she was there. And then they said, “Just don’t worry about it.” This was the wrong day anyway. We were supposed to come on a different day. And then another dream, I dreamt that there was this TV commercial advertising like a Frankenstein series of like shows, like Jag. And it showed Madonna talking to Victor, and she said, almost like a kid playing – first she said, “There’s something I know you know how to do, so let’s do it.” And at that she created another person, I think. And it was like, “Whoa!” And oh yeah, then a little transient dream I had was there was an empty vitamin bottle and Mom wanted me to put it outside for the chickens, and she said, “Let’s give the chickens a nothing treat!” And then I said, “Okay, let’s give the chickens a nothing treat,” so and I was getting ready to put it outside, but then I realized it still had half my vitamins in it so I put it back in the fridge. That was stupid! And then I woke up."
542,"Ok I am recording this a few days late, here is what I remember. My dad and I go into some movie theater. He hands me a black button. I look at the button and think it has some substance on it where if I swallow it something weird would happen to me. We sit down to watch the movie, it's an animated movie about the coming home of some man. However, what appears on the screen after the intro is my button. It zooms in on the button and you see this little cave man looking creature using some kind of tool to chip off some substance that was on it. THis was a microscopic sized man. Then a woman walks up, she was much taller then the little cave man and had long blond hair. Then in the distanced you see another little cave man walking up behind her. He hits her over the head and knocks her out. The narrator then explains that this is how humanity started, that the caveman and the blonde united and had a family which eventually grew into a city, as that is said I see this beautiful city emerge from the ocean. I am guessing it is still extremely microscopic. Almost as if there is another whole world so small we can't see it. Now it's back to the normal movie, and we see people getting up and walking out. Then the screen goes black and an announcer explains that ""the movie can't be finished but that's why I showed you all the baby was a girl so you would know how the movie ended"". Dad and I walk out of the movie, I am still holding the button."
543,"I was in my room and I think a bomb went off or something. We must have lived in some apartment complex because there was this huge court yard in the middle that had these enormous  art structures, one was like a big circle. Anyway, when the bomb went off the structures fell into the building. The ceiling of my room collapsed. I remember thinking I was going to die. I was pinned under this structure but was some how able to squeeze out. I realized we had to get out, we had birds and I was asking my dad what we should do with the birds, we decided we should set them free so at least they would have a chance, I opened the window and let the birds go. Now we are in some little vehicle, kinda like a golf cart, trying to get out of the building. We get to the elevator and see that it's completely obstructed, yet somehow we get out. Then we are all going to pile into a car. I see my cat remmy outside and he looks extremely scared, he is running around all confused, kinda crouched down. I call him and he sees me and runs over. We get in the car and start to drive off, then I realize my mom isn't there. I said something like ""where's mom"" and no one responded. I was very upset and yelled ""HEY!!!!!!!"". I obviously said it in my sleep because I woke myself up screaming HEY!!! I felt very uneasy upon waking up yet at the same time didn't want to lose the dream, I feel immediately back to sleep. Now I am standing on the street alone because I got out of the car since they left my mom. I found my cell phone sitting on the ground, I saw it didn't have much power left. I called my mom's cell phone and she answered. I asked where she was and she told me the place . I asked her how I was supposed to get there and she explained. THen I repeated the name of the place back to her. I was very worried we wouldn't be able to connect. Then I am in a hotel. I am waiting for my mother, when she comes we are going to go to California where it is safer. I nap and then some lady comes over, she is a hair dresser and says she will be back shortly to do my hair, she never comes back though and this frustrates me. My mom finally calls and I ask her when she is coming and she says she will be there soon. THen I woke up. "
544,"Ok my ""nap dreams"" always seem much more vivid. Took a nap this afternoon. I am in my condo and look over at the window, which was open, no screen. A lady is standing there. I look a bit confused because I am on the  floor and can't figure out how she could possible be standing there. I walk up to the window, it's an older lady red hair. I peer out and see she is on a ladder. I tell her ""Oh I feel so much better I couldn't figure out how you could be standing under my window like that. I figured I must be dreaming."" She laughed, then she climbed through the window and came in. She was delivering something for me. She handed it to me and it was my IRS tax return for . She said it was $. I start writing a check but then I explained that I requested this over a year ago and no longer needed it, it took far too long. She said no problem and took it back and I didn't pay her. Then she made a comment asking if I remembered her. I couldn't place her and she mentioned she had taken care of my cats once. Then I remembered. She handed me some envelope, I open it and there is some sort of newsletter in it. It's on white paper with green writing. Then I ask her about her website, because I remember at one point she had said I was going to do the site for her, I don't recall what she said but I believe she had someone else do it, I felt slightly offended. She left and then these  guys came over. I don't really know why they were there but they seemed to know me. We were talking and then they said they were going to go out and get some beer. I was like ok! Then my mom, loy and my cousin brian come by. THey come up and make themselves at home. Brian is sitting on the couch and I am on the chair next to him, we start talking but I don't remember specifics. That's all I remember, the dream was quite vivid though and I almost became lucid. "
545," Last night I had this dumb dream that my white chocolate candies and my chocolate covered cherries came in from Elizabeth’s fundraiser, and I dreamt that Sheryl and Sandra and Sam were in town, and that Sheryl was supposed to pick them up from Mrs. H.’s room for me and she did, and she like got herself an extra set. Well, I find out that Sheryl has a dog and she’s just giving my white chocolate bunnies to the dog like dog food treats. And I was so mad because those were supposed to be for us to eat, and here she’s giving them to a dog! And here I paid $ for those suckers. And I can’t remember too much more."
546,"I was somewhere and found out Godsmack tickets were on sale . ANyway I was going to purchase the tickets for  of us. I was doing it online. It was a cool system because it showed where the seats would be. I found out that if we got  seats together we would be in the  row, yet if we split it up with  seats and  seats we would be in like the  row. So I went that route. I went and told my friends what tickets I got and they seemed upset that I didn't get all the tickets seated together. I explained that I wanted a good seat, I didn't want to be + rows back from the stage. I remember we fought about it awhile but finally agreed. I guess the tickets weren't going to be officially purchased until I logged back on and did something. I tried to get online and couldn't so I went home to access the internet from there. I believe I was able to get online. Now I am at home, my mom's house, and she says that she is having some party tonight and that I had to attend. I must have been a teenager because it was as if I had no choice. I was really mad because I didn't want to go to the stupid party. Now I am viewing the dream in  person. The person who was me is now this teenage girl, blonde hair. She was getting dressed for the party, she put on a blue and white shirt and a long red skirt  something I wouldn't have chosen. Then she goes outside and sees these  girls in the street screaming for help, these other guys are attacking them. I am first person again and I am walking towards them. I had a water gun but it was filled with hair dye. One of the guys started walking towards me and I began to squirt the hair dye in his face and eyes, he started screaming because it burned. Finally they ran off. That's all I remember."
547," I had kind of a weird dream last night. I dreamt that we had this black chicken who was kind of learning a little bit about how to be tame with people, and kind of watching what the white chicken and the red chicken were doing. And one day they saw the chickens jumping up on me, like they do, and being friendly and wanting food. Well, this black chicken decides she’s going to jump from the nest onto my arm, and hang onto my shoulder. And this chicken was so heavy, I thought I was going to die. Actually what it was, was she was perched on my arm and trying to hang on by gripping my shirt with her feet on my shoulder. And I don’t know why, but I could barely hold up this chicken’s weight, and so I kind of had to put her down. And then I dreamt that Stephanie Trix was coming by to bring us something and she had a portable radio and she was kind of using it like a cell phone to dial toll-free numbers. I can’t remember anything else; I know there was more."
548,"I am at work or in someone's office. In the office with me there is some guy who is a friend and some other guy who seems evil, it appears he wants to kill me. I get up on the desk and make my case as to why I should not be killed. This apparently pissed him off even more and ht grabs me and gets ready to throw me out the window. He pushes me out and is holding my waist, I am dangling out the window but he doesn't drop me. Then my friend pulls me back in. The guy died, not sure how, right as he was throwing me out, must have had the death grip on me so I didn't fall. LOL Now I am at my mom's house. We got a free chicken for ordering something from the grocery store. I'm talkin a live chicken here. I look out in the back yard and see the chicken running around. It looks like a peacock without all the feathers. I call my mom to tell her about this chicken and ask her where we should put it. She seems to think the backyard is a bad idea. I must have been talking to her on a cordless phone because I go out to the garage to see if we could put the chicken in there and I was noticing all the junk in the garage that the chicken would get into if we put him there. I also remember looking at bowls that I could use for a water bowl, for the chicken. Suddenly I get disconnected from my mom, she calls back and leaves a message. I go out front, it's night time now. I see our next door neighbors the McMillans . There are about  people, Cam walks by me, she has long brown hair and bangs. I see Mark in the distance and he waves his finger at me motioning for me to ""come here"". I walk over and everyone starts hugging and then we are all arm in arm running around the lawn.  I remember I stopped walking, since I was in the middle, and just let my feet drag as they were walking around, it felt cool. They all hop in the car saying they were gonna go snow sledding naked. Ok. I hope in the car with them. Mind you there was no snow on the ground. I had on a skirt and sandals. We get to this snow place, must have been fake snow. It was like a water park where it looked like a slide but it was made of snow. I remember thinking my feet were gonna freeze! They all go up and get in line, the naked part was gone now because no one there was naked. This one kid comes flying down the snow slide and then walks away. I grab his mat  and walk up the stairs to the top. I put the mat on the big pile of mats that I see. There is a line of people. I look back and I see the pile of mats start to topple, the guy in charge of the snow slide caught them. Next to the slide I am in line for there is a bigger slide that has these round innertube type of things that more then one person can sit on, it is also made of snow. I see one go by and there are these  little black girls in it. They couldn't have been older then about , and they were flyin down the hill bouncin all over the innertube. I was like, why the hell would their parents put them on that, how cruel. I am no longer in line, I am peering over this low wall and I see someone I know named Mike. He doesn't recognize me, so I say something. Once he does recognize me, he walks off as if he wants nothing to do with me. I tell his wife to go get him because I need to talk to him. Once he comes over I tell him about the dream I had with the guy trying to throw me out the window, and that I thought it was precognitive to something else. I am telling him about the dream and there are these  black teenage girls standing near by, they are listening. As I get to the part where the guy tries to kill me, I walk over closer to them and tell them because I don't want anyone else to hear. I also run into an old friend Shawn and some other black guy who I supposedly worked with. Now suddenly I am back at my mom's house, I wasn't sure how I got there. I was worried because I knoew the McMillan's would wonder where I was. I closed my eyes and tried to teleport myself back to the snow place. I did this a couple times the last time I was almost successful as I felt something very strange occur, but no luck. I look on my cell phone to see if any of my preprogrammed numbers are the McMillan's. I see one for a maid and then some other number, but that was it. Then Mrs McMillan calls and leaves a message to the affect that she new I was at home and no big deal.with. Suddenly back at moms house unsure how i got there. Then I woke up."
549,"I am with some guy, we approach his car, it was an old VW bug. I ask if I could drive since I hadn't driven stick in awhile. He says ok. We walk to the car and the passenger window is down. On the window sill there are ice creams and sodas, we throw them again. Now suddenly there are  of us, myself, another girl and  guys. I was like, all  of you can not come back to my mom's house! Then we started driving. There was a black truck with  black guys driving. One of them was hiding his face partially with a scarf and partially with his arm. They were pointing at one of the male passengers in our car and wanted us to pull over. Fuck that! Now suddenly I wasn't driving anymore I was in the front passenger seat giving directions. I knew we were near my mom's house and I knew there was a police station near by. I tell him where to go and he pulls out into on coming traffic and we almost get hit. Now we are under some bridge and I tell them to pull over I know a short cut. THey pull over and we all get out. We go up this stair case and come out in this shopping center. We run into this building, not sure what it was really but it wasn't the police station. We run into those one man who asked us something, then we leave the building. He comes out after us and told us where the police station was, but I said it was quicker if we go this way. Some other kid follows us out saying we left a mess in the bathroom. I tell him we are on our way to the police station and that we would come back to clean it up after. I point to a gift shop and we see they are open, I mention that if we go in there and go out the back way the police station is right near there. I go through the door of the giftshop, which is now a window. As I climb through the window it looks more like someone's townhouse. The portion we are climbing through is like an upper loft and you can hear people on the floor below us. I go down to the first floor and look back up where my friends are still coming in. Then I spot the black guy that had been chasing us. Shit! I tell a woman on the first floor that she needs to go get the cops, she runs out of the house to get the police. After a moment I run out the front door and there is this big black guy standing out there, and tells me I'm not going anywhere. Damn. I decide to stay out in front of the house with the guy. I get the impression my friends inside are being forced to do sexual things. Then the guy out front starts to touch me and makes me very uncomfortable. A cop and security guard walk up and asks if everything is ok. I felt, for whatever reason, that if I said what was going on something bad would happen. So I said everything was fine but I was trying to speak to them with my eyes and let them know there was definitely a problem. The cop finally leaves, I was hoping he would come back. No lots of people are inside and my friends are being forced to perform sexual acts, I can't really see what's going on. The black guy outside grabs me and keeps me close to him, he continues to feel me up and molest me. Oddly enough in the dream it turned me on yet at the same time I was scared and very uncomfortable, there was nothing I could do. I see one of my friends start to get dressed, she was talking to some females inside the house. They seemed friendly. The guy that had been out front with me was now sitting on the couch next to some white girl. I look for my shirt, I guess it wasn't on me, and put it on. We start to leave and the black guy who was outside with me implies he is coming with me. Although this time I don't feel threatened. He pretty much says he was just doing his job but that he really wanted to get to know me. We walk across the street and see the brother of one of the guys I was with and ask him for a ride. Then I woke up."
550," I had a dream that I was at the dome with Chuck Flaherty and I was doing a bunch of stuff, and I was traversing the, well, first I was up in the control room with him and I had to go down to the desk to get some papers for him. And then I think I was going to go, but some lady gave me a graduation pencil and I forgot it, so I went back up there and I had my cane because there were so many steps and so many odd things, and nobody really seemed to ______ out any different, I just kind of found my way around. And there was this one set of steps that you had to down like a ladder, and I was glad that I had it, because if I didn’t, I would have just went “splat” off the edge. And then I made my way down and for some reason I had the notion that the audio control room was outside and down a little path, and down some more steps and down next to the water, where like a fishing deck would be. And that was kind of cool. "
551," Before that I dreamt that I heard from Dixon, and he wanted me to bring all my stuff out on the same day that I was having a game at Foster Field, and I was saying, “Man, that’s going to be a whirlwind.” And I don’t remember anything else."
552," I dreamt last night that the kids were coming to town and we were going to go to the beach to get everybody tan. But some people said that they just don’t go to the beach, so we didn’t, and we were all kind of sitting around the table kind of deciding what we were going to do. And we decided to go scuba diving, and so we kind of stayed on the dock, Mom and Dad and I, while the kids actually went in the boat and scuba dived. They were like anchored and they didn’t really scuba dive at all. They just kind of jumped in the water. So what the thing was, is you had to jump off backwards off the ship, meaning you had to stand on the back of the ship and face the ship and then jump off without facing the water. That was pretty odd. And also, I think at the same time, they were doing some kind of concert where they had these like mini synthesized accompaniments and various people were coming up to sing. Well, you know Dad and his control factor, he went over and he put on this one song that he liked, and nobody went up to sing to it. He just let it play. That was strange. I know there was more, but I can’t remember it. "
553,"Ok first I was with some friends, this girl named Ruby who I used to hang out with in highschool. We are near her house and I have to use the bathroom, she tells me I can just go on in. I run into the bathroom because I really have to go, I leave the door open out of habit since I live alone. Suddenly this girl walks up to the door. I feel really embarassed and apologize saying I didn't realize anyone was there. She doesn't seem to mind. As I get ready to leave I see Ruby's son Andre  as he walks by, he is a very good looking kid. Next I am going on some trip and it was a bunch of people who were going as well. We were all on a bus heading towards the hotel. We were going to be breaking up into  groups. Teens, then those who were between - and then everyone over . Well there weren't many people over  except for some really old people, so I was like fuck that and I joined the - year old group because I knew it would be more fun. Now we are at the airport I guess the trip is over. The rap artist Jay-Z is there and I must have known him in the dream because I go up to him and give him a hug  and then we start talking. In the airport, because of the high security, you can't leave the airport or enter the airport without showing identification. There is this small room you go into, you show the guy your ID and then he let's you out the other door. People coming into the airport do the same thing only going the opposite way. Well I can't find my license and I also remember that they never asked to see my license when I entered the airport earlier. I am frantic because I know I won't be able to leave without it. I get up to the door and tell the guy I can't find my license and he tells me I can't leave. Well shit! I make some calls but have no luck trying to get some help. One of the guys on duty goes to lunch so the small room becomes really FULL of people. It was a room with all glass windows and benches along the windows. Probably only about  feet by  feet. Everyone was just standing around. I go through my purse again to see if I can find my license and I find it! But I still can't leave until the moron gets back from lunch. Finally he comes back and I show him my license and get out. Then I go to this lovely shopping center and stop by Advent . It is in this really beautiful location. That's all I remember."
554," My birthday. I had a kind of a strange dream last night. I dreamt that I was in the summer transition program for Watson  Center and it was more like being at Full Sail. Me and three other students were in this room and there was this big, huge synthesizer mixer board. It looks like a huge version of my Tascan board, but it was this guy that was the instructor and he was showing us about how, he was showing us with an organ sound and he wanted to change it, but he couldn’t get any others. And so when this other guy came in with another student, he asked the student to show him. And you had to mix automation and change it. Then I dreamt that we were in the car with Edith and Suchi and Bonnie and they were all kind of, you know how they’re all kind of complainers. Well, for some reason Josie gave me a thing of milk and said, “Here, take this so we won’t have to wrap it.” And they took us home and then we were home and then I woke up."
555," Last night I dreamt that we were at this Great Exploration exhibit or some kind of fair thing, but it was inside. And there were all these various things, and there was an area that said “Teachers,” but it should have been “Singers,” because they had a Sade display, they had a A______ display, they had a Celine Dion display and they had a bunch of other displays, and there were a few rides and a few little movie things going on. And I was there with Mom. Before they showed the exhibit – I can’t remember what it looked like, though – and we saw the Celine Dion exhibit – well, actually the Shaday exhibit was kind of elegant, kind of nice. The Celine Dion exhibit was kind of blah. It was set up on a table and it was a board, this round wooden board, and there was this real cheap, short, stout chinsy plastic figure of her holding a guitar. And there was this magnet and this magnet would move her around the board as the song My Heart Will Go On would play on this blah thing that was there. There was a whole other room that we hadn’t gotten to yet, but there was this red door that said, “Teacher’s Exit” and I had the notion that when you go out it, it would make an alarm sound. So it would go into like in a kitchen thing. Oh, I know, all of a sudden I had my CD writer there, and I am recording something, the machine freezes like it did for me yesterday. It keeps getting hotter and hotter and hotter, then I realize that we started a fire. So we were running around now in the house, so we’re running around and we don’t know what to do, but the porch is like really long. Remember the teacher’s exit, I tell Mom, “Open the door and run out,” but she doesn’t. We just run out the back door to avoid all that, and I think she gets it under control before it really turns into anything major. And then I woke up."
556,"  … came from the fact that yesterday my machine did have a freeze and it screwed up my CD that I was making, and I had no choice but to turn off the power while it was recording, and you’re never supposed to do that. But it was in a freeze and I had to get it unfrozen. And another thing, we had a fire drill yesterday at school, and Mrs. Sanchez’s room is the only room that has a fire alarm thing right in the room, and it like jarred us out of our skin yesterday. So I think that’s where that part came from. Now the cheap part, I don’t know. "
557," Last night I had a crazy dream that I was going to my birthday party and it was going to be a place that looks like Shady Park’s Club Saturday dance room, and so the plan was that I was supposed to enter real slowly with a wireless microphone in my hand and give a little speech and sing “Happy Birthday” to myself, like I’m going to do at my graduation, kind of like. But I forgot all about the plan and I run in there because I want to be involved on the party, and I have this notion that I’m late to the party. And so I get in there and I start partying and dancing and stuff, and then I get up by the sound table and I’m ready to sing “Happy Birthday” and Dad goes over to the sound board and starts screwing up the levels, so that I’m way low and the music is way high. And then I go over there and I’m like, “Hey, what the heck are you doing?” And I’m like trying to readjust it and having to justify why. And I dreamt that the CD player had two separate outputs for its two separate trays, and that we had to mix on the mixer so that the right hand try would be on the right channel only, and the left hand tray would be on the left channel only. And I understood this and Dad was having a problem understanding it. And I’m trying to get him to realize what’s going on here and what we gotta do, and before I know it, well first, everybody at the party is gone by that time. And then I woke up. I was going to say this early this morning, but I had the machine out and ready to go and rewound, and before I could record and speak, I like fell asleep with the thing close by. That was weird."
558," I really had a stupid dream last night. I dreamt that I had to get, it was like dark, it was early in the morning and I had to get on the bus to go to school. And it was okay to ride the bus naked, but it’s just, I mean, the boys didn’t mind, I just couldn’t show some of the more squeamish girls. So it’s okay to ride the bus naked, but it wasn’t okay to go to the bathroom all over everywhere. So I really had to go, so I’m like by the side of the house going to the bathroom, and buck naked, and I’m peeing like a totally gully washer, and I finally finished that, and then I go poop. And oh, that was a lot! And there was like gooey yucky mess all over everywhere and I can’t even wipe up because there’s no toilet paper. And then the bus pulls up and I’m running to the bus and trying to streak past these squeamish girls. And I get on the bus and I sit down and I’m finally okay. And we’re going to school, and that’s all I can remember. I think there was more, but I can’t remember it."
559,"Ok I should have entered this this morning, but since I didn't I only remember sporatic pieces. One portion of the dream I decide instead of moving to California that I will move to hawaii. So I just pick up and leave. Another thing I remember is being in this building, it was like a store or something and suddenly I saw all these people put on the masks that cover your mouth *not a gas mask* but the kind people might use for allergies. I look up at the TV monitor and they are saying something about a bomb coming out way. Another portion, I am in some place with other people, there is a guy there who seems to really like me, I like him as well. There are also some females there who don't like me. They caught me doing something, don't remember what, but I played it off and ended up talking my way out of it. There was so much more to this dream but it's gone. :( "
560,"Oh my god I had some insane dreams last night. First I am in the car with my mom and this black guy somehow manages to get in the car. At first things are ok but then he starts to get sexual which makes us extremely uncomfortable. I don't remember how, but we managed to get him out of the car. The I get to my job, even though I don't work there anymore, and I go into my office. I guess I went there to train them on a project. I'm in the office doing some stuff and then I peak out and everyone is there, and suddenly realize I am not supposed to be there. I sneak out and head downstairs. I go outside and I run into the black guy who was in the car, and some of his friends. They start coming towards me so I run back inside. There are a bunch of people inside so I feel safe. However, somehow the guys were able to figure out what my name was, which scares me because I figured they would find out where I live. I go home to my mom's house, feeling quite stressed and uneasy. I go to sleep. While I am sleeping I have a dream, in that dream within the dream I become lucid. Although it wasn't full lucidity since I was dreaming of having a lucid dream, vs. really having one, it was odd. The dream took on exaggerated dream like qualities since I was dreaming a dream. I get out of bed and walk down the hall and it was weird because I only saw what was straight in front of me, everything else was out of focus, I walk down stairs to the living room. Then I wake up from the lucid dream, although still in the other dream. My mom is now home and I run into her bedroom and was crying. I asked her if the incidents with those guys had really take place, and she said no. So I asked ""So it was just a dream?"" and she said it must have been. I was like, ""are you sure?"", still feeling uneasy. Ok not sure how I got to the next part of the dream, but I am in some restaurant with some guys we are all sitting at a table. Somehow it dawns on me that I am dreaming. I immediately become fully lucid. I put my hands down on the table and look at the  guys I was with, and just smile. Then I think ""what should I do"". Finally I decided to fly instead of immediately go for sex. LOL I walk outside and it's night time although still light out. I am in the parking lot and there is a hill right near me. I run towards the hill and jump up as I come to the edge of it, I float up a little and then start to come back down but manage to stay just above the ground. I was moving more like I was floating then flying. I see a girl and guy in the parking lot and float over to them, I think to myself, ""that's mona"". I land on my feet and say ""hi Mona!"". Mona is like ""Krystal!!"". I corrected her and said ""No it's Kelly!"". . I shake her hand and we talk for a brief moment and then I turn around and fly off, and I over hear her say ""That was Krystal."" lol I am flying low to the ground and I see the black guys again, they spot me and start running towards me, I shoot up high in the sky and they keep running as if they didn't see me go up. I follow above them and then I remember reading something on a lucid website that lucidity is a great way to get over your fears. So I figured I would land and confront the guys because I knew they couldn't hurt me in my dream. Although I am suddenly having a really hard time seeing and try to focus by opening up my eyes wider and of course it makes me really open my eyes up and I wake up, OH I was pissed! LOL I immediately fall back to sleep but no longer lucid. There is something going on and there are all these groups of people competeing against one another. This one race we are in there are  of us who have to swim together, one person holding on to the other persons feet. We have to swim back and forth underwater in this small bathtub. I am the one in the back and the girl Kelly Rowland from Destiny's child is in the front. We get a time of like  minutes. Then I am driving in a car, in the community that this event is taking place to try to find some food. I have no idea where I am I get to this one really curvy road which was cool. Now I am back at the event and I notice the times everyone else got and we came in last place. lol The others got like  minutes and  minutes. Now I am watching this one group of people there are about  of them and they start doing this little dance routine. This small asian girl runs up and joins in and the lady in charge of the dance routine announces her as if she had forgotten her. That's about all I remember."
561," Last night I dreamt that I had this, I was at my graduation party and all the guests had come in like two hours and then it was like at : and they were all kind of chowing down on the food and stuff. And I entered slowly and gracefully like I planned to, and nobody even seemed to notice; they were so busy eating and talking, they didn’t even see me coming in. Then I don’t know where, I was outside, and I realized that it was a different party that I was barging in on, and so I had two hours before mine was actually going to start. We were looking at these Hershey kisses and deciding whether to put this on the table or not, and Dad said that if we put them on the table, people are going to throw their wrappers on the floor and it’s going to look sloppy, so if they want Hershey kisses, they can ask us. And then I said that, well, if people want Hersey kisses, how will they know to ask us? If they’re not on the table, they won’t want to bother us for them. And so we ended up putting them on the table anyway. And that’s all I know."
562,"Ok my old job, not my last one but the one before that wanted me to come in and do some contract work for them. I went in and met with Pat and Chris and Jackie. Pat went over the project and I asked a bunch of questions. I realized I wouldn't have to come into work until next week though. THat's all I remember it was really short."
563,"Ok first I am with some people and we are all talking. I remember seeing a clip of a movie and then I see one of the guys who was in the movie. In the movie he was rowing a boat and it looked really fake almost as if he were actually sitting still instead of moving in the boat. I asked him if it was filmed fake and he said yes. There was some other guy sitting near me and I remember splashing water on him. Now this part of the dream gets interesting. I called the bank and had some money transferred to another account. Then there was another thing that needed to be moved but it looks like it had been an error because it was the same amount and had the same id as the previous transaction or something like that. I tried to explain to the lady that we couldn't transfer it because it was a duplicate. She didn't seem to understand but I kept trying to explain. Finally I went and got a pen, now the lady is standing next to me. I write out the ID of  and the amount of $. Then underneath I write the ID of  again and the amount of $. I show her they are identical and that we can't have  records with the same ID, she finally understands. I am now at a store. I am standing in line to wait to pay for something, can't remember what i was going to buy but I notice someone had spilled some dirt on the counter and the lady pushed it aside. As I waited she passed around a plate of cookies. She was passing them to everyone but me. Finally she offered me one, I broke off a piece of a very yummie looking chocolate chip cookie. I remember eating the cookie and actually tasting it and it was good. Then as I wait to pay for my item I see some other cookies behind the counter that are for sale, but they look different then the ones I just tried. I consider buying some but change my mind. Now I hear a song by Ike Turner  that he sang near the beginning of the movie at a club. Anyway it's playing on the radio, and I can hear it distinctly. I look over behind the other counter and there are these  black guys that work there and they are singing along with the song. Then the phone rang and I woke up."
564,"Ok I am laying on the floor and I somehow know I am dreaming but I don't actually become fully aware and take control. I am laying there in some store and these people are walking past me. I am masterbating and I don't care since I know it's a dream. Then this girl comes over and she gets down and starts eating me out, she gets in the position so we can  and I start eating her out too, at this point I actually feel myself cum. This is the oddest part because when I woke up I hadn't actually cum yet it felt like a full fledged orgasm. Then I have to pee and I kind of still know I am dreaming. I sort of fantasize  that this guy was forcing me to pee in the sink, although since i knew I was dreaming I didn't actually go. Weird. Then my mom and I were at some mall. We went into this store and were looking around. I remember we were trying to find some stuff made in a specific kind of metal. Now we are looking at some things on a rack and I accidentally bump into this little guy and he kinda pushes me back, I look at him like how odd! Then, I had to pee and I asked the guy where the bathroom was. He told me to go downstairs and to the back right. So I walk towards the escalator and this guy says something kind of rude as I get on the escalator but for some reason I don't take it that way. I get to the bottom and start walking to the back right and then I woke up and of course had to pee really bad!"
565," Last night I had an absurd dream, and the tape is probably going to flip any minute, so beware. I dreamt that I was at Ace Field on a Saturday and Frederick was showing me this hand-held, real heavy device that reminded me of, it was about the size of the talking calculator, but it was a little heavier. It was some kind of audio editing device, and it was kind of a bluish color and it had a real wide LCD display. And it had a few keys along the bottom and a few up the side. And Frederick was seeing that the labels were unusually large and they could actually see all of them. And he wanted to make sure I could see all of them by asking me where to find the keys that went up or down, the volume ____. And I found them like in the bottom right area, and I upped the CD about three or four notches. And then I realized that in order to edit audio and put programs together, that I had to have these – what’s the material? – I had to have these clay alphabet letter blocks, and a lot of them were attached together vertically in a column, and some were loose. And I didn’t know what I had to do with these alphabet letter blocks, but I had a feeling it was like making a story board for a movie. And there was also this book that was like the length of a novel that went with it. And Frederick was going to try to teach me a few things so that I could make an order, because I had a notion that I was having a party that evening and I was going to make a border for the playlist for the party. And then we like ran out of time and he let me just take the thing home and learn some stuff on my own and show it to him on Monday, because he realized we weren’t going to have any more time before the party. I remember looking at the time and it was : and I had to get home because the party was at :. So then I make my way to the front and up the, I mean down the elevator, and I realize that I’m at Sycamore Gardens and I ask the lady at the front to use the phone because I dug in my purse and I didn’t have the cell phone. And her phone was like whacko. It was like you would pick it up and instead of a dial tone, there was this commercial for like Spanish food, and you had to actually push a number before it would have a thing. And so first I dialed - and realized that wasn’t the one, so put it down and tried again. And then I dialed our land line and I don’t think I got through. Before I finished, I hung up and there was, so I’m going to say that before I could get through, Mom came and picked me up, which was good, so I didn’t have to call. She picked me up in the parking lot, and instead of the car, she had the blue car that was like all beat up and these broken windows and this yuckiness, and I kind of was a little startled, I was like, “Where did you get this?” and she was like, “It’s Joan’s.” And she said that it was a special model that was made to look like this to show that it had been through the war. And I was like, “What?!” And soon after I woke up."
566,"I worked at some place and I had done this website. We were going to have this week long conference. I get to the conference and someone is talking about the site with another person that I work with and thanking them for the wonderful job they did. I was actually the only one to work on the site but no one bothered to mention that, so this person was taking all the credit. This really pissed me off and I let them know it. Then I am suddenly in the Antartica, although I think it's Australia. I was there with some guy and it was morning time. I was saying I couldn't wait until night fall because we would be able to see all the stars. I realized I had left the conference without telling anyone so I shot over an email to explain. I come to find out, some how, there were some murders and a bunch of us were now suspects. We decide to go to the store to get some food. I pick up some crackers and a few other things. My friend is paying for his stuff and I am over to the side, when he is done, I step where he was and lay my stuff down to pay. The guy next in line gets PISSED because I cut in front of him. Can't remember what he said but he was really mad, I would have been too. I try to explain in the dream that my friend was holding my spot, even the cashier thought it was wrong. Then we fly back home really quick in order to do something. I get to my moms and check my email and it appears they are still looking for the murderers. For some reason I have a feeling they are going to pin the crime on me. That's all I remember."
567,"Ok this was odd. I was getting married to some guy, although in the dream I knew him but couldn't recall what he looked like. We were having the wedding at some really nice hotel in California. My mom and I are waiting on the coordinator. She finally comes and says something about the caterer being late. That they are driving down from Mendocino. I am anxious at this point. Then my mom and I go into this little courtyard where the actual ceremony is supposed to be. As soon as we step onto the grass we see it's all wet and muddy. I was pissed, how the hell can we have a wedding in this mud? Then I fall down, I wasn't in my wedding dress thank god but I fell right in the mud. I couldn't get up so my mom came over and tried to unstick me but couldn't then my dad came over and got me out. I had mud all over me. I remember several times I was doubting if I should get married and wondered what would happen if I just walked out. We walk to the end of the courtyard and I see my groom. He is this short  little guy, very light complextion, curly hair, but quite adorable. We hug as if we have known one another for years. Now we are in his room talking it appears he is a musician as well as a feather-weight boxer. LOL He is quite famous and I remember people had followed us back to his room asking for autographs. We were talking and I saw a bunch of gospel CDs. I asked him if he had a problem with the fact that I was not Christian, and he said no. We talked some more but I don't recall the details. I never got to the actual ceremony in my dream though, I ended up waking up."
568,"So my mom and I were vacationing at some place, we were staying in this house where some of our friends live. My mom and I were sleeping in this one guestroom. Anyway during the day some sorority came to the house and ended up taking over that room. There were like  people in there and they were going to be there all night. Well I needed a bra, so I had to knock on the door and intrude into my OWN ROOM to get a bra. I go to the drawer and pull out the bra, and hear some laughter. And I say ""Well i can't have my titties flyin everywhere now can I?"" lol I leave the room and figure we need to get these females out of our room, I didn't want them going through all my shit. So we call someone in the room who has a cell phone and tell them that they need to leave but they don't want to. Grrrrrr. I remember there was this one female in particular who was super mean and just figured she owned the place. The next day rolls around and I tell my mom I am ready to leave. She agrees, so we decide we are going to go home. I tell her I want to take a shower first. I go into the shower to wash my hair, and the shampoo that I put on my hair feels all greasy like lotion, so I try some of the other bottles of shampoo and realize that they had filled most of them with lotion, stupid bitches. I was really pissed. I did manage to find some real shampoo. Once I got out of the shower, I went into their bathroom and filled all their bottles with shampoo too! That's all I remember."
569,"Weird one. I only napped for about  minutes. Started dreaming that I was at home and napping but that I kept waking up. My mom was at my house and kept coming in and out of the room. At one point I opened my eyes and she was sitting in the window swinging on something, I had to look again because I was like wtf? I kept waking up but felt extremelly tired and would fall back asleep . Then finally I get up for real. I am only wearing underwear . I step out into the hall and then head back into my bedroom. My mom comes in and says ""jim or james is here"" not sure which name she used. I was like who? Then I look out my bedroom into the bathroom  and I see my old friend Tabitha in the bathroom. I was like ""Mom why didnt you say I had company I just walked out there naked!"". I also told her I had had a really odd dream, and that I always have odd dreams when I am napping. I found my clothes and got dressed. I walked out and there was Tabitha and Nelly the rap artist and one other dude all sitting on the floor watching TV. Although Nelly wasn't Nelly in the dream he just looked like him. I said hi to everyone. Told them I leave in  weeks for California. I sit down with them and then I look over to the backyard door . I see these people in the back yard trimming the trees. They appear to be relatives of one of the guys that came over. I asked them what they were doing and said ""well that's a good way to make some money."" He said it wasn't for the money they were doing it for the racetrack. Whatever that meant. THen my alarm went off and I woke up."
570," I’ve been having a little bit of a dream dry spell, but last night I had a pretty really neat dream. I dreamt that Dad had bought me this Little Mermaid videotape because it was on sale at Blockbuster, and it wasn’t the original story, but it was kind of like a side little story – not necessarily a sequel, just kind of like another story. And so we sat down and we were watching it, and we had the surround sound turned on, and I went up close to see it, and of all things Flounder and Ariel were at a casino gambling and Flounder was like putting money down with his fins. And there was like all kinds of flashing lights and stuff going on , and there were these other mer-people there that were like doing the same thing. And then all of a sudden, in the middle of their like card game, I guess it was, Ursula comes in and like waves her magic wand and makes everybody like silent and still. And Ariel and Flounder managed to escape because the other mer-people turned to stone, and then all of a sudden I’m like in the movie and I’m at this like Adventure Island kiddie pool, and this girl who’s kind of dressed like a mermaid is saying, “Jasmine, come this way; you’re going the wrong way.” And I’m trying to remember what else was in it. I don’t remember too much else. And that’s all I remember unfortunately. I didn’t have time to take this down this morning and now it’s like  hours later, I guess, oh no, it was like a few. Now I’m all confused. Well anyway, you get the gist."
571," Last night I had quite a dream. I dreamt that Sheryl and Sandra and Sam were coming for my graduation, and they were going to be here in like a few days. And I was in the house and I think Sam was already here, and we were going to turn on the air conditioner for him so he wouldn’t be hot. And this evangelist girl, kind of like a Spanish descent, real nice and real sweet, was in Mom’s work room talking to this black street kid who was like, the black kid was like this big momma, like Missy Elliot just sitting there, and she was so mean and so harsh that the evangelist girl was trying to convert her and make her softer, but it didn’t work. So they both ran out of the house, and then I remembered I was going to the Dome, and so I got there and I didn’t know whose equipment was going to be set up or when, and I went up the stairs, and, of course, Dad was like following me the whole time. For some reason the gates were locked and we had to get somebody to open them up and let us in. And we went up the stairs and, to my relief, the guys were there setting up their equipment, and I had my cane for whatever reason, and I actually like bumped into a pole. So they set up the equipment – the board and the CD players – and they connected one of the CD players by way of RCA connectors, but they left the other one undone for who knows what reason. And I was trying to connect it, but for some reason I had the notion that the RCA connectors would carry all the power from like the power mixer. And so Dad was like, “You don’t have to turn the power off,” but I didn’t want to touch the actual receptacle. It was like I was trying to connect the speaker jacks while the unit was on, but it wasn’t; it was just the line level, but I thought that it wasn’t, so I was real, real cautious. And the RCA jacks weren’t these like regular RCA’s. They were like flat things that you have to slide into p_____. It was weird, and soon after I woke up."
572,"Oh this so kicked ass!! Well let me preface by saying, that I recently gave my cats to a good friend of mine. My allergies have gotten really bad so she agreed to take them for the next few months while I move and stuff to see if I get any better. She's moving out to Cali soon too so she will either keep them or give them back depending on my allergies out there. Anyway my cats played a role in this dream that's why I mentioned it. So I am dreaming and I see my cat Sidney. I become very emotional and say something like ""you can't be real"". Then I reach out to touch him and he is there, I pick him up and hold him and pet him. I was trying to think how he could have gotten back to the house and suddenly it dawns on me I must be dreaming. I figured if I was dreaming I would be able to move right through the window. I walked up to the window and went through it with no problem. I landed softly on the ground. Cool I was lucid. It was sunny out and people were walking around. I decided to fly. I started running down the street to gain some speed and thought to myself that I would probably run much faster than in real life, so I sped up and was running really fast. Finally I jumped up and became airborne. I was flying around the neighborhood. The scene began to fade and suddenly I was back in my bed. I figured I must have woken up again but then Sidney walked up to me again. Woo, still dreaming and still lucid. I walked back to the window. I stuck my hand through it, and I could feel the pressure of the window around my hand but it went right through. So I popped through the window again. This time it's dark out, there are all these fires  and tents and what not. I had a feeling it was something military. I wanted to fly again so I did, this time I am flying over the ocean although the scene kept fading I couldn't see as clearly as I would have liked. Back in my bed again, this was becoming a vicious but cool cycle. I see the cat so decide to continue. I go out the window yet again. Now I am with some group of people and I see this one cute guy sitting off in the distance. I walk towards him and then the scene fades, grrrrr. I rub my hands together and try to bring up another scene. I am in this room with some people and I see this one guy with gorgeous blue eyes. I sit down on his lap and begin to kiss him. . Now I am in front of my mom's house. I look down the street and can see about  houses, all pretty detailed. I start to fly and while I am flying I decide I want to find Sully . So I am going to fly over to some concert they are having. I see this girl walking along and I swoop down and grab her, like I was kidnapping her or something. She had some little electronic device on her and I told her to let me know what her password was or I would drop her. LOL I was only semi- lucid at this point. That's about all I remember. There was more to it but it was definitely the longest lucid dream I have ever had."
573," I feel really bad about not remembering my dreams when I wake up. But today I have a vague memory that we were staying at this hotel at this conference like type thing. I can’t remember everything, but I was like, Dad and I were in this bathroom and I was cleaning myself up because I had been sleeping and sleeping for until :, which I never do, but that day I did. And Dad decides he’s going to turn off this tub faucet and make it flab, and so I was naked in the bathroom and I came out of the bathroom and walked down to our room, and it was totally dark, so nobody could see me, but there were other people in the hallway. So in our room, and then I decided to go back to the bathroom and I go to the wrong bathroom. I go to the men’s room and there’s this guy taking a shower in his clothes and everything. He doesn’t even really notice me, so I’m okay. And then I go back to our bathroom and things are kind of okay. Oh, and then I kind of got some clothes on and took a walk around, then I was coming up the stairs to go back to our room, and this lady comes up to see me and she’s like, she gets on a portable radio and calls the audio man, Dan Dram – his name is really Dan Dram, but they call him Dan Drama from the Dome – and wants him to help me. Like that was strange, man. And then at the very end, before I woke up, I dreamt that my back was hurting really, really, really bad because I fell from _______ all around."
574," Originally I thought that this dream was way too silly to put on this tape, but now that I’ve had enough conscious time to mull it over, I think it’ll be okay. Matter of fact, let me say that, first of all, this dream was the first one that I’ve ever thought was too silly to put on this tape. Here’s what it was: I dreamt that I had to go to Grad Night that evening, which really is what is today, but before I went to Grad Night, Dad put this responsibility on me that I had to prepare this little pizza thing in the fry pan, and I also had to turn on the air conditioner. And how you would do it is you would light a torch and you would kinda light the air conditioner with a torch, and the air conditioner, we called it the Hossle , so I had to take this torch – believe it or not – the plastic end  – this gets sillier! There was this prize that I won from a raffle that was a little pocket torch keychain, like a cigarette lighter, except when you turn it on, it smells like a torch. And they called it a portable cruise torch. So I was using this portable cruise torch to light the Hossle and so I think I had to like turn it on and I got it near the air conditioner and it didn’t light. It was starting to get out of control and so I threw it in the water to put it out, but it wouldn’t go in the water. I ended up shoving it into the side of the blue cabinets, flame and all, then there was a towel close by and then I realized that it might burn things. So I took it and it got stuck like a magnet there. I had to like pull it off. And I threw it outside and I never did get the Hossle air conditioner lit, and I know there was more. I think I was trying to fix some kind of food for somebody, and I think somebody was coming to town, but I don’t remember anything more."
575," I had kind of a silly dream last night with a lot of silly things that weren’t really connected in any kind of way. But first I dreamt that I was at school and I was trying to go somewhere. And the elevator in the main building was like real small, only enough to fit like me and another person. And I was in it by myself, and I had to go up to the third floor. And I kind of had the notion that there were more floors than three, so I kept pushing  to get to go up higher, and then all of a sudden I realized that it was going up past the third floor and into the control room shaft and the little trap door thing on the roof kind of lifted up for a minute and then banged down. And then I was like really scared because I thought I was stuck up there, and then I realized all I had to do was press  and it would start coming down again, which was exactly what it did. And another thing – kind of later when I was outside – I was walking down the hall and these two, this guy and this girl were talking about something juicy about their relationship, I guess, and they were like kinda singing and kinda talking, and I kind of thought they might be fighting even. And I was trying to follow them and hear what they were saying, and I followed them into this classroom and I sat down kind of in the back of a row and it was real noisy and stuff. And I realized I was in Ms. Marcos’s class, in her  period, and I didn’t want to be caught dead in a math class for an extra period than I had to be, so I got up and I walked out, and then I went downstairs, and I think I was going to some kind of party, but I woke up before I could get there."
576," Two days ago I slept in Grady House when we were at hot springs and I had the dumbest, silliest, stupidest dream – you would not believe! First of all, I dreamt that I was at school and it was kind of like one of my last dreams and we weren’t doing much in class. And we were all kind of hanging out and partying and having assemblies and stuff, and there was this show, movie-like type thing that I was going to go and see in the auditorium with Mom. It was going to be a combination of Celine Dion and a few other people singing and doing things and stuff. And one of the officiants in the VE specialist office – I can’t remember her name – but it was Mrs. Bernard or somebody – was going to show me a shorter way to get there. And she said that I had to go through the Teacher’s Lounge and through some teachers’ special areas that no other students could go. Well, when I started going through that area with her, it was like a long hallway and a tunnel and several twists and several little office areas to go through, and there was this sound system that was very quiet, but audible, and very keen and very thin and very blah – no frequency band width to it whatsoever. And so, of course, just like the Dome, it was mixed with this “buzzzzzzzzzz” sound, and as you were walking through this hallway, you would hear the sound coming, there would be the speakers mounted – some on the ceiling, some on the walls kinda of close to my waist height, and some on the floor. And you would be walking by and any time you would get near one of them, and you could feel the sound waves. It would just give your muscles these sensations, these shaky, jittery sensations and you’d like fall down and stuff, like when I walked under one, it gave me these like tingles down my spine and just made me shudder. And then I passed one at my waist height and it like almost made me fall down. And there was one – I was coming up to one that was on the floor – and I just kind of totally like freaked out. And I can’t remember exactly what I did, but this assistant just kind of was walking along ahead of me and this was normal, and who was I to think it wasn’t. And I think that I forgot something out of my locker, and I had to go all the way back around, but I went the long way and I wasn’t going to go the short way, so I went the long way again. And then I finally got to the auditorium and the show was like starting already. And there were bleachers in there and I was walking down these big bleacher things, and actually there were like bleachers on the side and everybody in the middle had like normal seats. And I was going to sit on like one of the big bleacher platforms up real close so I could see. But I got there and I sat down, and Celine Dion was like in these long leather pants and this black top like I have, and she was singing something – I don’t remember what – and then in the middle of a song she like takes off her clothes in front everybody and changes into this black dress that’s kind of to her knees. And nobody does anything, nobody in the video audience or the real audience does anything. They’re just like, “Okay, this is normal.” You know, that’s all I can remember. And I think there was some guy, like Michael Jackson who was singing too, and that’s all. Obviously this was a spin-off on the Dome offices. It’s just that my imagination went absolutely crazy because the Grady House had a whole house system too, and, of course, theirs sounded nice, but now I hope I’m not going to have this dreadful memory every time I hear a whole house system like that. It’s just that I had this dying curiosity of how they work and what makes them work and how they’re wired and stuff. But when I don’t know these things, it’s kind of frightful. I don’t know how to describe it. Especially when they make weird sounds and so weird things like that."
577," Last night I had kind of a dumb dream. I dreamt that I was at school and they were having like this graduation fair party. And I was there with Elizabeth. And Mom was going to come and join me. And Mom went in the bathroom and said, “I’ll meet you guys outside.” And Elizabeth and I went to this classroom that was set up with little work stations, and they were supposed to be like audio work stations, but ours was kind of like bland because somebody stole our mixer board, and there was just this TV playing like video footage that somebody took with a camera. And Elizabeth and I are sitting there watching it because, you know, she thinks it’s like really cool, and next thing I know I’m kind of falling asleep. And then I start getting really into it too, just watching everything that this person videotaped. And then all of a sudden, it didn’t feel like too much longer but I realized it was three hours later, and the whole party was over and Mom was back to get us and find out what happened to us. And I was so mad that Mom didn’t come and get us sooner, that she was in the car taking me home, I was screaming and yelling and whipping my purse out the window and like, “Why wouldn’t you come and get us? You made me miss the party!” And I was so resentful that Elizabeth sat there, bored as anything, but she was watching that movie that I thought she thought was interesting and we missed all the rest of the goings-on that day. And so I don’t know what that means, but that was kind of dumb."
578," Today is my graduation. Last night I had this very, this dream. It wasn’t really that scary, but it probably was supposed to be, I don’t know. It might have been set off by Dracula or it might have been set off by being with Sandra and Lee who are Christians. I don’t know what it was, but I dreamt there was this really awful like monster’s den, but what it was is you would go down this river, and if the current would pull you the wrong way, you would get down this tributary that after a while, once you got down further and further, it would be, there would be more and more monsters trying to get at you. And they would all be surrounding you and they would all be moving in for the kill, and there was no way that you would survive that. And the worst part was, after you died, just like in Dracula, you would become undead and you would become one of them. And I had my little subdreams. I like dreamt that I was awake, and then when I wasn’t like awake, I dreamt that I was like involved in that. And I would always like wake up every time and be like in the first level of dream before it would really be like not real. And I dreamt that I like read in the newspaper that there was one way to get out of that, that was to ask Jesus for forgiveness and suddenly you would just be out of that river and back like on some sidewalk. And I don’t remember too much more. I know there was a lot more, but, of course, I put off putting this on here."
579," Last night, you know, I’m still having crazy dreams about the undead, from reading that Dracula book. The concept is supposed to be so scary and so horrible, which it kind of is, but it’s more cool than anything, you know what I mean? So last night I dreamt that Sandra like came to me in my sleep and like laid down next to me, and somehow I had the notion that she was undead and she was like visiting me. And she wasn’t going to, she didn’t scare me, she wasn’t going to take any of my blood, but I was going to like give her some so that she could like come back to life or something dumb like that. And that’s all that there is to it. I kind of faded into consciousness."
580," I had a crazy, but fascinating dream last night. First of all, there were like several things to it. First of all I dreamt that I got several birthday presents, at this time of the year – yes, birthday presents! Maybe because Terri gave me a late birthday card or something. One of them was this mechanical baby doll that like it was the form and the stature of a real person, of a full-grown person, but it acted like a baby doll. Its arms like would reach out to you and it would laugh and say, “Mama” and stuff like that. And if it was turned on, it would just do that periodically at any time. And Dad was like, “That thing! How are you ever going to get any sleep?” But he didn’t realize that all you had to do is turn it off and it wouldn’t do that any more. And I thought it was a really special gift from somebody, I don’t remember who. Then I dreamt that I was studying media in college and I needed something to help me study it, and Dad and I went to this electronics store to get one and the one, the Peavey one that we were looking at was really, really good. It was kind of a mixer and bat kind of combined into one unit. And then there was this other one that was even better and this was the funniest part. The Peavey one that we were looking at spanned three octaves, but this other one spanned like six octaves, and so Dad wanted me to have the Peavey one, but he wanted the store person to cut the other one in half and attach the half to the Peavey one and make it one unit. I don’t get that! And the store owner said, “Well, there’s a much easier solution. We have a larger Peavey model.” And so we ended up getting the larger Peavey model. And then I dreamt that I was working for the Devil Rays, and not like a DJ but to do like paperwork and stuff. And I had a desk in their offices, and somehow – I don’t remember how – but I must’ve put it on my desk. And there was this other girl who had a desk next to me who was studying video and stuff also, and we decided we were going to like hear it, and then I can’t remember, but I was off running errands for them or something, and I come back and somehow somebody had talked me into just giving it to her, and getting another one with my gift card, and so I had this nice, perfect model and when I got back to my desk it wasn’t there. And then I like rolled around or something like that and then I woke up. And then I was like half conscious, but having other little tiddly dreams but keeping that thought in mind that, I don’t know. Then I woke up. I have a little bit more of an explanation about the baby doll part of this dream, now that I’ve been thinking about it. When I was little, I had two kind of small talking baby dolls. One was supposed to be a boy and one was supposed to be a girl. One was from Brittany and Jane and one was from Aunt Peggy. And they would laugh and they would say, “Mama,” but they wouldn’t like reach out to you or anything. And I think, oh, I know what, when their batteries kind of ran down, they talked like this  and they sounded like an old man, kind of like my tape sometimes. And that was just so weird. I think I might have been thinking about that."
581," Last night I had a dream that I was at this youth center place, kind of like Club Saturday, but they were having this like workshop thing and I can’t remember exactly what it was. But I was in this room, like a dance studio, and Sheryl and me and Mom and this strange instructor person were in there, and they were showing me a trumpet, of all things and they wanted me to just try it out and see how it felt. And I could feel the finger things and I remembered when – I don’t know – it was just weird. And then we went out to this main like cafeteria area and there was a, it was empty and there was a piano in there and some girl was like playing. And I was like walking through there to get out to the door to go out, and the instructor person who was with us gave me this little book, thumbnail size book of songs. And then when I got out to the car, Dad and somebody else were there to pick us up, but I realized that I left my MD machine in the room, so I had to get out and run back in. By this time the cafeteria was full of people, and noisy students. So I went back and got my machine and then I went, then we went to this like funeral thin, I guess for like James Walton’s dad, and I was kind of perplexed because we said we weren’t going to go. And somehow I got separated from everybody else and I was like sitting behind the first row and I was watching the thing going on. Then when it ended, everybody kind of got up and left and I was like left in there. And I got up and I started walking. There was this big, long and there was this big complex at the funeral center, and as I got up and I started walking, there was like this bridge over the pool, and so I walked over that and I started to cross the front lawn. And then this lady came out and stopped me and said that this path was going to lead me into private property because there were condos over there. And she was going to lead me like back to the parking lot. And so she led me to this path that had these sprinkler heads sticking up that you could trip over at any minute, and we were walking along this path and suddenly they came on and sprayed all over us. And then we got to this like little clearing area deep in the woods and somehow Mom found us and found out where I was and went back to the car and told everybody. And I don’t remember ever getting back there. I woke up before I got back."
582," Last night I had a dream that we had taken a car trip up to California to see Jack and Polly for a family reunion, and this is so weird – you’d never believe it. Dad said when he was snooping around out back he found these alligators trying to get at these chickens, and a few of them were dead already, but the alligators were in the water and the chickens were up on the thing. And he got two or three of the chickens out of the way, and I can’t remember, one of them had like chicken wire wrapped around its ankle, and I don’t remember what all the ruckus was about, but I think it was that somebody like fell in the water and they like jumped out, but Aunt Polly saved Mr. Thomas and Mrs. Dougherty. That was weird. And we were all like packed into their bedroom, just talking and visiting and chatting and yakking and carrying on, and Dad’s laying there on the bed totally exhausted, wanting to go to sleep. And here we are visiting and talking and carrying on. And so it was really, it was Jack and Polly and all of our family and we were like having a family thing. And then I dreamt that – oh, I know – somehow we were supposed to have taken a trip up to their house, but somehow I had the notion that our sound system was in their living room, and Jack and Carl and Mom were watching a movie. And I was going to tell Jack how the system is wired, but I never got around to it. But then I dreamt that Mom and I went to this park to swing on their swings, and one of them came undone because she was trying to figure out where Ohio is. How dumb! And also we went to this library because I needed some kind of book on psychology or something, and I turned the ______ and had to go to a big philosophy library that was right next door. And we were set off to drive all the way back to my home state, and then I woke up."
583," Last night I had kind of an odd dream. I dreamt that, for whatever reason, Mom was waiting for an ambulance to come and get her, but yet in the meantime she was going to take a walk with me. Now doesn’t that sound weird? And so we went and we walked over to this like kids’ playground thing and then – this is all kind of like mixed up in my memory – so we were at this playground thing that was all built out of wood and it was like kind of a maze thing, and they had all kinds of neat things. But I couldn’t find any of them to show her. And somehow I dreamt that I had the notion that I was at school and time to get out so that I could get to the parking lot where they were going to pick me up. Well, at school the halls were like flooding and they had water up to my ankles, and I took my shoes off so that they wouldn’t get all wet, but from taking off my shoes I couldn’t keep my balance as well, and there wasn’t much more to it."
584," Last night I had kind of dumb dream that I was at Camp Stamford getting ready to go to Spain, and I had my bags and stuff and I was walking around and walking around thinking, and then I realized that I didn’t know what city I was laying over in and I didn’t know what time the flight was leaving, and I didn’t know any kind of information. So I sat down on this railing to this stairwell and I was taking stuff out of my purse that I didn’t need, like this vitamin bottle with one vitamin in it and these papers and stuff, and I called Mom on the cell phone and she couldn’t really tell me a lot. And she was there like within two or three minutes of me calling, and she was saying that I should try to meet up with Mrs. H.’s group but I didn’t know where they were, and I think they had left already. And so, as it turned out, it was like late at night and there was nobody around to help me out, and they shut off the lights for the stairwell and I like started freaking out. And I just decided I wasn’t going to go, and I like ripped my ticket and I got my bags, and I was ready to go home. And then I woke up."
585," Last night I had a dream that I was setting up the Peavey system in the back yard because we were going to have some kind of Father’s Day party, and I said I was going to test it out. So I played “Pink” and Dad kind of left. And Mom and Dad were sitting on the picnic table, but Dad left because he didn’t know _________ for the song that ________ was in, and then while he was gone we thought he just left because he didn’t want to be at the party. So we continued with the party. Nobody else came over, but we had kind of a party ourselves, but it was in the middle of the day, and I don’t know why I would do a party in the middle of the hottest part of the day outside. And then I dreamt that I was at this like class in this portable classroom, and they were doing this stuff and somebody was telling this story about how, if you were in the military and then you leave, you wear your armor home and then you take it off, and then it jumps under your skin and you can never get ride of it, essentially a symbolistic thing. And that was kind of odd."
586," I don’t know how much tape I have left. I know it’s going to shut off in the middle of this, but I guess I’ll at least try. I haven’t had a dream like this in quite a while, so I guess I’m not going cuckoo. Okay, last night I dreamt that Mom and I were coming home from somewhere and it was kind of late at night, but then again I had the notion that it was in the afternoon. And she, I was kind of laying on the bed when we got home, and Mom got this big box from her room and I was laying down, almost asleep, so I couldn’t see it. But I could hear her taking something out of the box, and she said she got me an early present and she couldn’t resist showing it to me. It was supposedly a keyboard that spans like five octaves. And she plugged it in and she started playing me a song, and, you know, she was good! I can’t remember what it was, but she was good. And then she played me a second song and for some reason I didn’t clap and go “Whoo!” or anything. I was just laying there half asleep. And I didn’t realize it until she had put it back in the box and then it was like all kinds of stuff on the bed, like rollers and shampoo and clothes and bags and purses, and I like knew that’s on the bed. I wanted to see how big the box was. And I realized, I was like, “Wow!” So she was going to put the box like up in her work room. And then, for whatever reason, she decided …."
587," The beginning of a new tape, obviously!  Oh well, that’s dumb. I had a dumb dream last night that I had just graduated from high school, and for whatever reason all of the teachers wanted to have all of us back for ten more days, and especially Ms. Marcos. She had, I can’t remember, I think it was something like the fact that the state mandated that shove a couple more lessons down our throats and she didn’t get to it. And in order to cover her hide, we had to go back ten days after we graduated and get a little more. And then Mr. Johnson decided he was going to do that too. And I had to go to the Wa______ and I was trying to figure how to get all this in at once. And it was kind of weird. I can’t remember much of what happened, but the gym was like this big open, dark area and it just was different. And I woke up and I realized it was only a dream, and I was so grateful. But then I went back to sleep and I dreamt that I was in a dollar store with this little boy, and I had to buy certain things. And I was buying these gummy dinosaurs, and I like took a handful of them and I took them up to the counter and I paid  cents each, and then I woke up."
588,"I remember a few parts of this dream. In one part I took some Ecstacy. I took  pills instead of one, and was worried that I might freak out or something. Marty was there and I asked him to stay with me to make sure that I didn't become incoherent. He agreed. Then I remember being at my mom's house and the phone rang. Some ominous man was on the other line and he said something in a low whisper. It sounded evil and really freaked me out. I remember being scared and thinking he might be in the house. Although we never did run into him. Also some of my pets and some other animals, including a baby tiger, were at my mom's house. At one point it felt like the Ecstacy kicked in and I could feel it's effects in my dream."
589,"I only remember a portion of this dream. I was at someone's house and they were getting ready to move. They had a whole bunch of pets that they couldn't take with them. Initially I volunteered but then I realized they had  pets and my house couldn't handle all of them, I think they had a few birds too. Anyway the pets were  sets of dogs,  set was  cocker spaniels , another was a set of wild felines, I think it was a lion and a cheetah, and the other was another set of dogs, don't remember what they looked like. I was concerned because I didn't know which to choose and I also didn't know what would happen to the ones I didn't choose. That's all I remember."
590," Last night I had a dream that I was at school again and after class – it was like the last day before break – and after class I went to this ______ restaurant called Ceasar’s Pizza with Jenny and some other people and there was this band there and they were all like singing and having a good time. And we each got one of these little pizza things where you rip off a piece of crust and you scoop some stuff, and that’s how you’re supposed to eat it. Well, I finished that and then Dad came to take me home and it was flooded. I mean, we were practically swimming through the parking lot; the water was up to our chest. And in some cars there was water like halfway up the doors, but with ours somehow we were in a lower area, it was like only a little bit up to the tires, I guess. And the funny thing was, he started backing out and maneuvering out with the door hanging wide open, and he said that he was going to honk real loud to make sure he got all the way out of the radiator, which I don’t understand. And I don’t remember much more; I think that was it and then I woke up."
591," Last night I had a bizarre dream. I dreamt that – I don’t remember how we got there or anything – but I dreamt that there was this fair thing, and we were visiting this small community with somebody we know, but I can’t remember, I can’t put my finger on who. And, you know, like they had relay races and stuff – well, this was kind of an odd type of a relay race thing that a family could do. What it was, was when there’s a lightning storm and the power goes out, some of the things that you can do to salvage things. And the first thing was you had to run all the way down to the end of the block and make sure that the transformer was still intact. Then you had to run back to your house and turn off your main circuit breaker in your panel box. Then you had to run inside and change your equipment to run on DC, and I don’t know where we would get that from. I didn’t remember anything about any kind of a generator, but I thought, “Oh, how neat!” Two other people did the going down the street and coming back to the house and all, and I would change, our sound system receiver had some kind of a switch to go from AC  to DC , and once it was in DC  mode,  volts, it would revert to this weird surround recording room that had a ____ and two surrounds and nothing else. And we were going to play a CD or something, or watch a movie, I don’t remember what. But I think I was going to do it out while the storm was brewing and banging outside, and I don’t remember exactly all the details; it’s kind of foggy now. But that’s what it was. And then I woke up."
592," Last night I had kind of an interesting dream that Dad and I and Mom were at the park and he found this book that he wanted to read to us. Lo and behold it was this, I had made up a story in my head in a dream that was kind of in this book, if you know what I’m saying. And what it was, was a story about a lotus blossom, and it was this leaf that died and in the next life turned into a little branch, which died and then in the next life turned into a flower and then a bigger branch, and then finally a tree. And it was talking about the venerable tree and how there’s different trees in different countries, and how respected they should be. And then in the very last part, a bird lands on this tree and the bird becomes the friend of the tree. And then after we read this book, we went home and I don’t remember, but something, I was in the tub and it was going, “Fwaaaaab!” I don’t remember too much more."
593," Bizarre dream. Well, first I dreamt that I had an assistant. It wasn’t really a hired assistant, but another student helping me. And I was back at my high school, or my college – I couldn’t figure out which one it was. And she was helping me find my room numbers for next year’s classes. I think it was Latisha from the Wilcox Center. And she was showing me where my psychology class is, but she said that if I go too far to one side, past the psychology class, I would be in the Special Ed Department and there were all kinds of whackos in there that I didn’t want to be around. And so she advised me to go around one way to get to the other thing. And then we met up with Sheryl and Sam, who had driven down, I guess, and Latisha kind of turned me over to them and went about her away. And Sheryl and Sam and I were trying to find an elevator to get down and we found one. We got down and out to this like pool area, and it looked like the pool was outside, but I guess it really wasn’t, because it was an echoey echo chamber around there. And I can’t remember if I wanted to get in and swim or not, but I remember that it was an echoey echo chamber. And Sam went in there started walking around and around the perimeter of the pool, saying, “It collapsed, it collapsed, it collapsed! The World Trade Center collapsed!” And this was kind of upsetting Sheryl, but she didn’t want to show it. I mean, this is totally off the wall, but that’s what he did in my dream. And then we got back in the car for some reason, and we were going to go home, and Sheryl was like laying in my lap and crying. She was like the size of me and I could like support her, and her legs were like falling on the floor. I could support her body. And she had dark hair like me. And, but I knew she wasn’t me; she was Sheryl. And then we kept driving, and then Sam was talking about next time maybe that Mom can run him down. And about that time I woke up."

595," I had the most odd dream last night. This was the night that Astrid slept over. I had _____________ what am I talking about? And I dreamt that something was going on in my studio while Astrid was sleeping and Mom was in her work room doing something. And I was doing something in my studio, like the sound, and I guess I kind of got turned on. And I don’t know how – she didn’t see me – but I think Mom found out, and she was telling me, “It’s too rough over there; why don’t you do that in bed, because Astrid’s blind and she won’t be able to even see you.” And I’m glad I woke up. That was just so ridiculous! "
596," Last night I had the most bizarre dream. I dreamt that – I can’t remember what we were doing, but we were going to have some kind of party at the house. And the, we had to have the amplifier receiver in the freezer. We had to have it centrally located there in order for it to work right, and it wasn’t big like big and bulky; it was small, it was the size of the microphone bass thing. And I think there was this singing group that was coming to the house, and again Sheryl, Sandra and Sam were in town. And they were going to have like a party on the porch. And we had like an outside system set up on the porch, and I couldn’t, we couldn’t get the sound system to work right, so Mom was working feverishly putting the food together and I was like opening the freezer door and messing with the receiver. I changed the selector from A to B so that it would be on the outside system on the porch, and meanwhile while I’m trying to do this to get it to work right, Mom’s like yelling to me that she needs me to help her with the food, and she’s like taking my trip and almost tripping me. And I told her I can’t do that now, I’ve got to do this, and I think she finally got the picture. And I finally got it to work right for them, and it took me a little while to understand which CD they wanted cued up because to me they all sounded the same, by this singing group that was kind of a bland version of the Spice Girls. And, let’s see, I think – oh, that’s it."
597," I am on a trip to Italy with a lot of my friends and their families. I am thoroughly frustrated because most of the girls on the trip are my age and most of the boys are juniors and seniors. All the girls are acting slutty and fake and all the boys are buying it. I like Albert and he keeps being stolen away by a group of slutty girls. Everyone is ignoring me. So that night , I just cried myself to sleep. I remember there being about  twin size beds just lined up against the walls. There was one room for the adults and one room for the kids. Everyone was talking loudly and having fun and no one noticed me crying. I am woken in the middle of the night  to find Albert sitting on the edge of my bed. I remember seeing his deep blue eyes and they shone in the moonlight. I also remember looking around and seeing all the  beds completely empty. So then Albert leaned down and just kissed me really innocently and sweetly. But then there was a knock on the door so he pulled away and looked really afraid. He said, ""I'll come back later"" and left. Then I woke up because my mother really was knocking on my door to wake me up."
598,"I'm in this elevator with Nick and Aidan. We are in the main building and for some reason we are taking the elevator down to the dining hall. So all of a sudden it stops really quickly and I fall to my knees and am perfectly waist level with both of them. So for some odd reason I think that they want me to give them head and I am really embarrassed so I stand up very quickly. When we reach the dining hall, it's packed with the entire school and then some. So Nick, Aidan, and I get out of the elevator. I'm walking towards the front of the dining hall and Nick is following me, saying, ""Hi Bea"" and I want him to keep following me and I want to talk to him, but I keep getting pushed so I lose sight of him and then I wake up."
599,"I dreamed that there was this war happening and that I was much more involved than I am in the war now In class we would have drills pertaining to the war. It was really scary. So all the freshmen and sophomores went on this trip and Sue and I were left behind. So when the trip returned everyone sought to create everyone's worst nightmare. All these people were chasing me and trying to shoot me, which I guess is my worst nightmare. I ran into my house, which was like the Order of the Phoenix in Harry Potter. Mr. Bailey was there with a palette of nail polish, trying to communicate some code to me. But I couldn't figure it out. So then I escaped to a kind of vineyard where Sue's worst fear was being realized. Her worst fear was that everyone had found out some secret about her. So there were all these freshmen and sophomores tormenting her in the trees of the vineyard, saying things like, ""We know, Sue..."" and then I remember one of them saying ""We know about Abbylius,""  and then I woke up."
600,"I dreamed that I was on this train. In each different car was a different song playing. And no matter how much I liked the song that was playing, I was forced into the next car. It was really hot in the train so I was wearing my bathing suit. The train stopped at my high school 's dining hall. I went in and everyone was studying for exams. I sat down at a table with my friends in my bathing suit. Ashley came up behind Olivia and put a lobster in her hair and we all screamed. Then she came after me with another lobster, so I ran away. I finally got back to my table and grabbed my bags before heading back to my dorm. On the way I saw Matthew and David, but they ignored me. Frustrated, I parachuted  away. I was so scared of Olivia and angry that Matthew and David had ignored me. When I got to the dorm, I realized that it was the beginning of school, even though I had just seen everyone studying for final exams. I realized I didn't live here anymore, so then I rushed to my new dorm where I found Sue. She told me that she, Hannah,  other girls, and I all shared a room in Bundy. When I got inside, I saw Hannah rearranging the furniture in a way-too-small room for  girls. I remember being furious that Hannah and I had to share a room with  other girls on Bundy , where all of Ms. Prong's favorite varsity athletes lived. I thought there had to be some mistake. I went to the closet to put my stuff there and realized that I had left all my clothes somewhere else. I ran back to the dining hall to look for them. All the doors were locked and I remember looking in the windows and seeing everyone in there being gassed to death. I remember seeing my father and Albert slowly dying. For some reason this didn't bother me at all and I rushed back to my room to find all my roommates playing name games, even though we already all knew each other. My other roommates' names were Brianna, Susan, and Kaylee. I was so frustrated I didn't have clothes, so I borrowed some from Hannah. Then I did have to take exams and I woke up."
601,"omg this dream was off the hook. I don't remember it all because it was so damn long and since I was lucid it just seemed to go on and on. I was dreaming and I was at my mom's house. Something happened where I was suddenly like ""Oh my God, I'm dreaming!"" I was sitting near some steps and looked down at the carpet and focused so I wouldn't lose the dream. I was able to hold on and was completely lucid. This is the most lucid I have ever been in a dream and not once during this entire dream did I even lose the lucidity, it was awesome, and it was like i was there. Anyway before I went lucid my brother and his friend were in the basement, so now that I was lucid I figured I would go down and talk to them. To test my lucidity I jumped from the top stair and slowly floated down to the bottom. Yep definitely lucid. I spoke with them for a few minutes, but don't remember what we talked about. Then I went upstairs. I did this twice before when I was lucid not sure why I keep doing it. But I decided to conjure up Sully Erna from Godsmack. *drool* So I was like ""Sully are you here?"" Walked into one room  and I didn't see him there. So I called his name again and I heard him respond in his thick Boston accent. I walked into the living room and he was sitting there in the chair. I focused on him and damn if it didn't look exactly like him. I gave him a hug and told him it was great to see him. Then of COURSE I kissed him, couldn't pass that up. It was quite realistic. Ok now the scene changes but I am still completely lucid. I am out in the back yard and I Look up at the sky and see a meteor fall to earth. It was a small one but very cool. I couldn't see too well in the back yard, so I went out front to get a better view. I saw a few more fall, there were also other people out front with me. Some more stuff happened at this point but I can't remember the details other than the fact that I was lucid through it all. Then I'm walking down the street and I run into Sully again. He was so happy to see me, he told me he was on his way to come see me. We hugged and kissed and all that. How lovely. :) Then I am sitting in what looks like a bar. My old boss Pat Osborne comes up to me. He sits down and looks very concerned, like he has really bad news. But he doesn't say anything. Now I am back at my mom's house. I am still lucid. I am in bed. I get up out of bed and walk to my brother's room. Now it was like I was having an out of body experience within the lucid dream. Meaning, it felt like, I was really standing over my brother, who was sleeping. But then he woke up and saw me. I was confused as to how he could see me if I wasn't really there. LOL That's really all I remember. It doesn't seem that long on paper, but I tell you this dream went on for what seemed like a few hours. I wasn't even trying to get lucid, I haven't for awhile, but after that dream I am definitely in lucid mode again, I'm going to have to try to start having them more regularly! "
602,"So I dreamed that it was May again and everyone was playing Assassin as usual. Only the whole school was divided into houses like in Harry Potter, and only the Slytherins could kill the Gryffindors, and I was in Gryffindor and couldn't kill anyone. The only way you wouldn't be killed is if you were caught with $ and your school ID. So I was walking down the main hallway and James Franco, who was in Slytherin, killed me. But then I showed him my ID card and $. But for some reason this didn't matter to him, and he took my money and ID card. So then I went to the library and Anthony was there. He was in Gryffindor too and he studied there for exams since it was the end of the year again. We were also hiding from the Slytherins. They were like the High Inquisitorial Squad from Harry Potter too. Anthony and I were studying, but we had a question about math, so we went to find Mr. Stipps, who was in his office blow-drying sour milk out of his hair. He was really mad that we saw him blow-drying his hair and threatened not to give us any more DVDs or help if we continued to stand there. So Anthony and I left. I went to see Hannah and Sue in Bundy and Anthony went to Langton. When I got to Hannah's room, she told me that Mrs. Frank had called and wanted me to babysit her children the next evening. She said I shouldn't because the next evening was the dance. So I picked up the phone to call the Franks to tell them I couldn't babysit, but as soon as I went to dial the number, a woman's voice came over the receiver and said I couldn't dial. I ran to Sue's room to use her phone, but the woman's voice came over her phone too. So I then went to each room on the floor but all the lines were tapped. I finally went to the last room to dial before the woman figured out that I was using that phone. But I couldn't dial the number because all the numbers had been rearranged and I couldn't find the proper ones. I ran all the way down to Houk to use the phones there. But when I got there the whole building was on fire. Everyone was carrying furniture out of the burning dorm. It didn't occur to me that this was weird, people going back into a burning building. There was a plate of treats for everyone who carried furniture out of the building. I started to go back to Bundy, but my legs were so weak I could barely stand. I kept stumbling up to Bundy. When I reached the small parking lot between Langton and Slate, I saw Hannah's dad in a car and he nearly ran me over. I kept trying to get up to Bundy. When I finally got there though, Mrs. Frank and her two sons were all waiting for me. Apparently they were a day early. Mrs. Frank told me not to listen to Seth no matter what he said, and I was so confused I woke up."
603," Last night I had a kind of a dumb dream. I dreamt that I was back at my high school and I was in the Media Building where there’s three stories. And to get to from one to two wasn’t hard, it was normal. But from two to get to three, I guess two was like extra tall and three was like up near the ceiling. You had to climb this monumental amount of stairs. And when we would ride the elevator to get to one, to two wouldn’t be too bad; that would be normal. But to get to three, it would take forever and a day, and sometimes it wouldn’t even go up to three or wouldn’t work right. And we’d be nervous about getting stuck. So I would just prefer to climb the monumental amount of stairs and work up there slowly but surely, dragging my book bag and everything. I remember doing that once, and then going kind of down an incline to get to the main building, and then I think there was a cat walk between that building and somewhere else. And I had to go down to get something. I had to talk to Ms. Fletcher or somebody, so I took the elevator down and then came back up. But then I dreamt that we were at this like little park thing that you could go out and be in. There were swans and ducks and pigs and things, and it was like a manmade park, but these birds just lived in there. And we would feed them and stuff. And they did these like shows, but I never got to see any of them. And I don’t remember anything more. Oh, and I remember the swans were real aggressive. They would come down and lick people, and then I don’t remember any more."
604,I had a dream that I was in the middle of the woods in a cabin. It was snowing really hard outside and I felt scared and lonely.
605,"I had a really scary dream that I went to see the movie  Days Later, which is supposed to be a scary movie about everyone getting a plague. So I was watching the movie in the basement of a factory or something. All the people I was watching it with got the plague from the movie. I got so scared and ran to my brother's room. He was there and we sat in his room and we were listening to Harry Potter on tape, but then he got the plague too! It was horrible."
606,"I dreamed that I was on this roller coaster water ride with Hannah and Sue. Just as we were going around a sharp corner, Hannah flew out into the water and drowned. I was so horrified that I woke up sweating."
607,"I dreamed that we were all going on a field trip. We were all organized into different buses and Sue and I were put on a bus with a lot of people we didn't know at all. So we were really frustrated. When we got off the buses we had to take out our English exam. I remember we were in this huge dark metal room underground. We were able to get our results the minute we finished the exam. But when I finished I couldn't get to where my results were. Then I remember beginning a new dream where someone was chasing me in the dark metal room, but then I woke up."
608," Last night I had kind of an odd dream. I dreamt that I was back at this place that was kind of, it kind of reminded me of like the Wilcox Center auditorium except it had a stage, and the room was kind of dark except for some stage lighting that was kind of bluish and a yellowish-whitish spotlight kind of in the middle of the room. And there was like a dance party going on, except the sound system was kind of low and it wasn’t really all that loud. But there was cluddy techno going on, and I was with Astrid and Linda and there were some families and parents and things there. And there were some like bleacher seats, as though we were at my hometown’s Jordan Center or something like that. But there was this big open foyer for us to dance around and then there was a stage. And I would be like, I would meet Astrid and Linda around, and then I would leave them with some other people and then I would go mingle around with some other people and then I was going to just dance. And they kind of toned it down a little and they were getting ready to do this show. And what it consisted of was this animal trainer person who was there, and had an alligator that was like almost twice the size of a chichahua dog and he was on a leash and they were walking him around the stage. And all of us people from the Wilcox Center had to line up and walk up on stage and go by and pet the alligator and say something to it. This is getting so bizarre! And then everybody was suddenly dressed like so nice. Somebody was in this like blue jacket and this black dress and everybody else was in like black dresses, and I couldn’t figure out where I was going to be in line and I like wasn’t even going to do this show thing. And Randy’s yelling at me from the back of the room, “Jasmine, go to the back of the room.” And then some other volunteers kind of helped me find my place. And before I could get up to the stage to the alligator, I kind of faded into another scene. I was in my studio and Terri was over working on my machine. And I had two monitors because what were supposed to be able to do is work from the PC and the Mac at the same time with the same mouse, but two keyboards and two monitors. And I can’t remember what I was doing, but I was doing some kind of a script or something for that show. I was doing the audio and DP and the typing in Word all at once, and Terri was helping me. And then I just faded into consciousness."
609,"I dreamed that Alexis and I were in this cooking show like  years from now because everything was really high-tech and modern. We were cooking something and all of a sudden  male strippers jumped out and started stripping. It was really weird though because Alexis and I wanted to leave really badly so we started looking for the exit. The woman who directed the cooking show was mean and scary and wouldn't let us leave until we had shelved all the cans that were all over the ground. And then we had to organize them alphabetically. So we started. Then one of the guys came up to us and said he would let us out if we helped him make dinner. So we tried to help him make dinner, but we couldn't for some reason. Then the cooking studio turned into sand and flames, a beach bonfire in the middle of nowhere. Then I woke up."
610,"I had a dream that I was giving a tour of my high school. When I entered the chapel, it was pitch black and I could see nothing except for this little boy with a laptop. He jumped up to greet me and then launched into this discussion of wireless Internet on campus. He wanted to show me how it worked, so he turned some of the lights on really dim. I was shocked to see about  other people in the pews, all really old and like the boy with laptops. He went into all these programs and messed around on the computer until the lights shut off of their own accord, indicating that he was now connected to the Internet. I was surprised and impressed and had lost my tour. But it didn't bother me. I went downstairs to the mailroom to find everyone happy and excited, all carrying or eating candies and chocolates, all with roses and dressed in pink. They all said, ""Happy Valentines Day"" to me. I was surprised because I had no idea it was Valentines Day. It was really dark so I couldn't find my mailbox, yet I could see all my friends with their stuff. As I finally started opening my mailbox, Leah explained to me how much candy she had received and who had given her roses and such. I opened my box to find only  pieces of candy. Feeling rejected, I walked back upstairs where it was light again. I remember hearing this voice behind me calling my name, and I looked behind me to see Sam running toward me with one rose. He gave it to me and kissed my cheek before leaving. Puzzled, I went back to my dorm, where I fell asleep really quickly. I was woken late that night because the fire alarm rang. Hannah and I ran out of the room to a secret hallway I never new about before. We were all to wait there until a train picked us up to bring us to safety. So when the train finally came pirates who had stolen it controlled it. They kidnapped everyone but me. I had to run and hide in a nearby bathroom. When they came looking for me, I cut them with razors and sprayed their eyes with hairspray, and basically defeated them with beauty products . Then I woke up."
611,"I dreamed that I was in a bookstore with my family. My brother and I found books about Harry Potter by J.K. Rowling, but they weren't the real Harry Potter books. We got them anyway. When we were checking out, my mother found a bag containing more bags of jellybeans. She was asking the main who they belonged to. I wanted the jellybeans and quickly told her they were mind and that I had bought them earlier. When we returned to school, I went to Sophia and Sue's room. Sue, Alison, Hannah, Aidan, and Jayden were all there and we started trying to take Sophia's bed apart to find something. Everyone was positive that it was an antique, Chinese-made bed, and therefore I would be able to take it apart and put it back together. I started to remove the different wooden panels, but never found out what we were looking for and couldn't put the bed back together. Finally Jayden and Aidan found a piece of wood shaped like an elephant that held the whole bed together like some sort of puzzle. So then I went back to my bedroom at home and fell asleep. But then Jackson, who had climbed up the tree near the window by my bed and was asking me to come outside with him. I was scared and moved to my desk. But my computer had been swapped with someone else's, and I couldn't use this one. Then, somehow, Jackson took my bed to his room. Horrified, I grabbed on and was flying to his room on my bed. When I got there he began taking my bed apart so that I couldn't leave; however, I got away anyway. When I got back home, my computer was right where it was supposed to be. I signed onto AIM and promptly started talking to Bill about his sister's relationship with his best friend, Sam. Then Jon signed on and asked me for my phone number to call me. I gave it to him and literally within the next  seconds, the phone rang in real life and I debated getting up to pick it up or not. But then I woke up and realized that it wouldn't be Jon calling since it had all been a dream."
612,"Last night I dreamed that I was walking through this swamp/bog thing. As I was walking, I came across a set of  bunk beds, all stacked up on one another. There were people having sex and they wanted me to join them. But I didn't want to, so I dredged on through the mud. Then I saw Jayden and Aaron fishing for frogs. With them was Aidan. He asked me to prom, but I didn't even know that the prom was so close, so I just kept walking. I finally had come to the end of the swamp and there were the dorms. For some reason Bellah was following me for accepted students day or something. So I tried to find my dorm room, but it was completely impossible. Instead of the hallway with rooms was a HUGE ballroom and lots of small dark corridors. And I couldn't find my room! Finally after walking around forever, I found my room. Outside it was a stack of books and a balloon with my name on it. Bella and I went in but there was yet another huge room. In this one was a cooking show. Fritz  was trying to guess what kind of sandwich they were making and he got tickled every time he got it wrong. I guessed PB&J, got tickled, and woke up laughing!"
613," Last night I had a dream that I was already starting college and it was my first day of classes. And I was heading to my psychology class in the Social Arts Building and in my dream it was a lot shorter. It was almost a portable almost. And I was trying to, well, first of all before any of this, the DART cab was coming to pick me up, and I had to run back to the house to get something and I was carrying my Wilcox Center bag in my other hand, and it was so heavy, and I kept tripping and falling and tripping and falling. When I finally got back to the house I asked Mom for some money so I could pay the guy and she gave me some. And then I was there and the security guard stopped me and was talking and talking and I was late for class, and I went up to this portable that was supposedly the Social Arts Building and there was like this little doggie door that was like the first door that I could get in. And I like opened and it and it went, “Squeak” real loud and then I just closed it and I stood outside. And when the teacher came out a regular door, and he was like, “Come on in and sit down. This is the first day, and I’ve had a lot of people late today. Just come in and sat down.” And so I did. And there was this assistant that was sitting by me, like Elizabeth would, and this assistant kind of reminded me of Randy. The teacher and the assistant kind of seemed to be doubles of each other, and doubles of this stranger person that was kind of like Randy. And they were talking about these chant songs and these songs with these sounds and these words in them, and the words were like all jumbled and we had to kind of make something of them. And there was this one that was like, “Leah, Leah, __________” – they kept screaming that name, and other students in the class were talking about how in that culture that Leah was a higher spirit, a higher power that they were chasing. And the teacher passed out a packet of papers, it was like a booklet of these different words and what they meant, and his assistant was prodding me to go over to a CC TV and look at it and read what it says, so I could ______ with the rest of them. And I was kind of feeling like I shouldn’t bother because I could always look at it at home and I should just listen now. And then I kind of started to fade into consciousness, and I realized, “Hey, this is only a dream. It’s only July  or . I don’t have to study yet.” And that’s when I kind of went back to sleep and faded into the dark."
614,"I had a dream that I was on a long trip. We were all on this bus and we finally stopped at campus. I needed to find an alarm clock so I would wake up in the morning. I searched all the dorms to find a faculty member who would have one. Finally I went to Langton and the Mings gave me one I could borrow. They led me through the dorm, onto different hallways, and into different rooms. In each room there was no alarm clock. I became frustrated and then went down to Houk to find an alarm clock there; however, when I got near the School Archives at my high school, all the electricity went out. Everything just shut down. The only people from my trip I could find were Jayden and Aaron. We all walked past the Main Building. I think we were going to my house to see if the bus was there. Anyway, we eventually found the bus and started going to another private boarding school in a really small town similar to ours. When we got to the school, we all went to the locker rooms to shower. I accidentally went into the boys' showers and they all wanted me to join them. I guess I kind of wanted to, but I was scared so I went to the girls' showers. They were all wearing their soccer uniforms, so I just wore mine too while I showered. The next day we had to take exams. Sue kept trying to copy off mine. Then for our history exam we had to see Pirates of the Caribbean. Then I woke up."
615,"I dreamed that I was in school and I had the absolute worst schedule. I had  period four days in a row and on Wednesdays and Saturdays I had all the periods. It was horrible. In Spanish, Sra. Perez made fun of me because I couldn't speak properly and I had to bathe Mr. Singer in history. When I went to English, I couldn't find my homework and I got into big trouble. I had  double chemistry labs a week and it was just turning out to be the worst school year ever. Finally, I went to math one day and it was the same class I had freshman year, except it was in an English classroom. The big projector was down and all the lights were off. Everyone was having sex and Anthony and Lou were there and they wanted me to have sex. But I was scared, so I went home for Thanksgiving break. I was at Sue's house and I went through this door outside. I was on a big mountain. Lord Voldemort had returned and was eating Thanksgiving dinner with us. No one else knew it was him, and for some reason, I wasn't allowed to tell anyone else. On the mountain were Ron and Hermione, and Sue and I were throwing turkey to them to save everyone. But behind them were a lot of other bad people, so we were trying to get rid of them without hurting Ron and Hermione. Finally Ron and Hermione got up the mountain, and Lord Voldemort walked right by us. Sue understood and we both left because we were scared. We went to the lake because we had to try to take a boat back to my high school. So we started carrying out boats to the shore and ran into Mrs. Carter, who told us that my high school had moved to France. We ignored her and kept walking with our boats to the shore. We got into the water except we weren't in the boats. There were little kids in the boats and Isabel and I had to safely get them across the lake to my high school and away from Lord Voldemort. There was a fish that grabbed onto me and when I shook it off, it started to have babies. Then a snapping turtle chased us to land. Then I woke up."
616," Last night I had a dream that I was still at my high school and I was carrying a bunch of stuff. I was carrying my book bag and one or two or three other heavy bags of stuff. And I dreamt that I was at this meeting to plan the prom that was supposed to be August . Now isn’t that ludicrous! I can’t remember any kind of details, but there was a regular school bus that was going to take me home with a bunch of other people, and this meeting kept me talking and talking, and I missed the bus, so I had to call Mom and Dad and they came and they picked me up. But before they got here, I think I had to go back through the school and back into the courtyard and around because I forgot something, and then I came and I can’t remember any more. Now isn’t that stupid?"
617,"Ok I'm getting really good at conjuring up Sully Erna when I get lucid, although, I'm not sure why I always do it. The moment I become lucid I think of him, LOL. Anyway I was dreaming and suddenly became lucid. I was in my mom's bedroom. I focused so I could see clearer then I called out Sully's name and he appeared right there, I walked towards him and tried to focus on his face to see if it really looked like him, and it did. I grabbed him, and kissed him, of course. LOL Then I thought to myself ""why do I always do this, when I could be doing something like flying etc."" So I kissed him one last time and told him I had to go. I walked down to the front door  and was about to open the door when I realized I could walk through it. So I walked right through the window, it felt really weird. Then I'm standing in front of my mom's house, it's night time. I see this really tall tree and decide to fly up to it. I jump up off the ground and float up towards the tree. At this point I had a false awakening. I woke up, in the dream, and I was sleeping downstairs in my mom's basement. I looked around the room and decided I should go back to sleep and try to get lucid again. So I fall asleep and become lucid again . So now I am lucid again but still in the basement. I remember someone coming downstairs although can't recall who it was. At this point I woke up for real, and it was over."
618,"I had a dream that I was at my high school, but it was just like Hogwarts and was magical. Professor Dumbledore was the headmaster. I had been going there before Kylie came too. So we dueled, and Dumbledore was on my side telling me what to do because my wand was messed up. Finally it snapped in half and we all had to go to Diagon Alley to buy a new wand. On the train Kylie made fun of me for being blonde, even though I'm not. So I got mad and then she cursed me to death. Then I woke up."
619,"I dreamed that I was sitting at one of the picnic benches at soccer camp and Aaron and I were discussing Anna Karenina and he had two of the characters mixed up or something and I was really frustrated with him because I knew I was right. I had the book and started to look it up. Just then my mother drove to pick me up and I left him. Then suddenly it was the first day of school. I was in the history wing and Ed was trying to show me something. He was pulling me somewhere and out of the middle of nowhere, Wyatt wanted to show me something different, so he began to pull me in the opposite direction. It was chaos because for some reason, it was also Parents Weekend. There were people everywhere. In the middle of everything, Gwenyth Paltrow was singing out of the blue. I was so exhausted; I finally went to my dorm. On the way, I met someone who gave me a pancake they wanted me to feed to the Maples’ dog. I took a bite of the pancake and it was really good. When I was near the science building, the dog came out of nowhere and began to bite me. I was so angry and scared that I ran to my room in Houk. My room was completely deserted except for a queen-sized bed in the middle, the room with my Laura Ashley sheets on them. There was a secret passageway into my real room where Maria and Zoey were getting dressed. I realized that my clothes were too small, so I had to borrow some of Maria's hideous clothes. Andrea was there too. I finally went back to the main building only to realize that I had no schedule. I couldn't figure out what classes I had. I searched everywhere and went to my mailbox to find it. Jessica came to me and told me that the teachers were trying something different; on the first day of school everyone would just go to their classes whenever they wanted just to see if they liked them. I went to English and then to history. In history, Mr. Singer brought us down to the soccer field where there was a car race. He lay down in the middle of the field and began squirting mayonnaise all over the place. Then he started reciting a speech of Abraham Lincoln's. No one found this weird though. Then I woke up."
620," Last night I had a dream that I was starting college again except this time I dreamt that I was starting my basics recording class and it’s called Music and Computers. And I dreamt that starting the class we were going to start in a regular classroom and do a little bit of study on theory. And I don’t remember too much except there were these things that some black girl copied off the board for me, and I could hardly read her handwriting, but I did recognize this formula that was kind of weird, and I couldn’t put my finger on it right at the moment, but then I thought about it and I decided that that formula was the formula for finding the frequency of a note. And then I think – I can’t remember what we were doing – everybody was kind of at a place that had a regular desk and then some other stuff. And for whatever reason, right at that moment I was out of class and I was setting up the Peavey system in this big open foyer because somebody was going to have a wedding or a party or some kind of a reception. And I turned it on kind of low, I thought it sounded from behind, but I guess from the front it was a little louder. Up in the balcony there was this guy that was yelling at me to turn it down some. And while I was like on the floor in this big open wooden floor, huge area rug room and there was these balconies all around, I guess kind of like the rotunda at the Dome except it was square and it had a wooden floor, but the acoustics were the same. And then, once it was on and I was kind of playing some easy listening stuff, I got word that the party had been like postponed for an hour or so, so I shut everything down and I was back with the class and we were going up this set of stairs to this band room. We weren’t really in a line, we weren’t going in any kind of order. We were just clumsily traipsing up the stairs. And this lady – Irene Doppley or something like that – I don’t know who she was, but she pulled me aside and she gave me this present. And I was home in my studio and I opened it, and it was this inline amplifier that’s supposed to make a signal from a microphone or instrument stronger with a little bit of effect before it goes like to a main house system. And it was like a little bigger than this tape machine. So that was really bizarre. "
621,"I dreamed that I was spending some vacation with Gianna. She was living in this humungous house and her dad was really rich and worked for NASA. In one room there were a lot of beds all lined up against the wall. People were lying on the beds, and each had on a pair of shin guards. Underneath their shin guards were their stories and how they had been injured and why they were lying on these beds. Whenever Gianna or I lifted the shin guards to read the story, however, they woke up and started laughing at us. Then they made some sarcastic comment that was supposed to be satirical and making fun of a movie. Gianna and I realized that we were on the set of Scary Movie , and that's why everyone was making satirical comments. When we got to the last bed, a woman leapt out of nowhere and grabbed the shin guards away from us. She asked us if we had tried them on, and we said no. She then told us that it was a pair of deadly shin guards, and that whoever tried them on died the next day. Gianna and I went back to the main part of her house where a lot of maids were cleaning the tile floor. We started to watch a DVD before her dad came in and told us he had to leave again. Gianna was really upset. He got into this enormous truck and began to back out of the driveway before he began to fly and took off into the stars. Gianna and I went into another room where there was a fruit snacks factory. A large pipe would deposit fruit snacks into bags in short intervals. The pipe had been clogged and everyone was trying to fix it. Then this dream ended and I began another one where I was in Paris. Some friends and I were walking down a small street and spotted a good-looking cafe. We went inside and it turned out to be a sort of cafe/ice cream parlor/bakery/candy shop. We all went inside and tried to decide what to have. They had some of the weirdest candy, like ""Antique M&Ms,"" where there was fruit inside the chocolate part. I went to go buy an ice cream cone, a coffee, and iced tea. I spilled the coffee as soon as I got it. Not wanting to pay for another. I filled it up with water and complained that they had given me water instead of coffee. They refilled it for me, and then I woke up."
622,"I had a dream that I was running around the main building looking for Anthony. I finally went to the auditorium to find him. I saw someone who looked like him very much. It was his father. He told me that Anthony was nervous to be around me because he knew that I liked him and he liked me too. A few minutes later, Anthony appeared looking a bit surprised to see me. I asked him why we hadn't seen each other lately and he didn't answer me. He said he was going to get changed and we could go for a walk. We took a walk down to the English wing, trying to find comfortable chairs to sit in. We saw people in their English classes and for some reason this was weird because it was supposed to be summer or something. We got to the end of the English wing and saw that the chapel was dimly lit. We went inside and saw Faith playing the violin. She left immediately as soon as Anthony and I got there. But she left her metronome on. I went to turn it off. Built into the metronome was some sort of sprinkler; when I went to turn it off, I got soaked. I told Anthony I was going into the little chapel loft to get undressed/changed. I crawled up there and went to a pew in the back and began to peel off my soggy clothes. Then I saw Anthony's face near the staircase and he came up and helped me get out of my wet clothes. Then he kissed me and I woke up. Then I dreamed that I was playing soccer and James Franco was the referee. He kept talking to me and teasing me until the game was over. Then I woke up again."
623," Last night I dreamt that I was in college again, but they were treating us like babies. There was this one woman teacher who had maybe fifteen or twenty of us that she had to take around to a various number of classes and we had all our classes together. And we had six periods a day, just like in high school. And fifth and sixth period we could go to by ourselves, but first through fourth we had to follow behind her in a line and she would leave us with these teachers and then come and check back with us. I think that was kind of a development from the Wilcox Center. This one class was supposed to be – I can’t remember why – but in my dream I couldn’t really stand up right. I had weak muscles and I kept wanting to let my head just drop to in front of my chest, and I couldn’t hold my shoulders up straight. And the teacher dropped us off. We were in this big foyer, kind of like the Wilcox Center auditorium, and this professor was, I think it was Dr. Stephan from my college, and he was leading this chorus of people a little young than me singing, “_____________” and so on and I wanted to go and join with them, so I came to the front of the line and the front of the like block of people and I stood. And again, I was having trouble holding myself up straight, and that one teacher kept coming over to me and tipping my head up and like straightening my shoulders and I just could not hold them up straight. Then, as we were singing and breathing and learning the song, the floor became more bouncing and more trampoline-y and more like a mattress, and it got bouncier and bouncier, the more we did. It became kind of like a moon walk thing almost, but it still looked the same. And when I tried to stand the way you’re supposed to stand when your stand – feet next to each other, everything in alignment – I just could not stand; I would keep falling down. So I had to stand with one foot in front and one foot in back a little ways. Then I could sort of stay up for a little longer, but I would still fall down. And I don’t remember too much more."
624,I dreamed that I was at soccer camp and we were all in the room where we watch movies. It was pitch black and we were all soaking wet from the rain. All the coaches were outside the room choosing courses for us next year. I was getting really frustrated because I wanted to choose my own classes. I didn't want someone choosing them for me. The door opened and a little light crept in. I realized I was alone. Aidan came in to tell me what he had chosen for me to take. I was really upset because I didn't want to take the courses he selected.
625," Last night I had kind of a whacky dream that I was watching something on TV that was Celine Dion celebrating her birthday in France on a beach. And she was like jumping around and dancing and singing this like club and techno song about “I got my suntan and I got my ________, I got my this and I got my that,” and part of it was in French, I guess. The next thing I knew this person came to the house, and I realized it was her and she was kind of short and kind of fat and she had short, dark hair. And she was wearing this tee shirt with like writing and stuff all over it. And she was kind of blah, she was kind of sarcastic like Terri is. And I would say things like how great it was to meet her, and how this is so exciting, and she would just laugh and kind of like “Everybody says that.” And then we had a slow dance together, and I just couldn’t stop crying because I was so touched. She did actually say something nice through her sarcasm, I can’t remember what it was. But I was just so touched, and I don’t remember anything else. … in my album there was this line that goes, “I can’t believe it ___________ to me”  – and part of it was a little flat and a little off key, so I figured I would highlight that area and try to transpose it and try to fine tune it by maybe  cents or something like that. Well somehow it kinda got all whacked out and it just went totally off the wall, and then it sounded like , “Oh, I can’t believe __________” and it sounded like a tape that was wearing out. It was the funniest thing. "
626,I can't really remember my dream. All I remember is opening a door and behind it was Aidan. I also remember getting his phone number but then losing it.
627,"I first had a dream that Valerie and I were in this great big house with Brody. We were playing some sort of board game. I think maybe somewhere on the game there were sexual references or something, because very soon he was assaulting us. Valerie and I ran as fast as we could through the house, but he kept following us. Finally, I took off my belt and tried to whack him with it. Nothing happened. Valerie and I ran out of the house and into Mrs. Carter, who drove us to another house. Aidan and Jason were there and they saved Valerie and me. Then I had a new dream that there was a wedding at Sue’s house. Everyone was dressed like Drew Barrymore in Ever After. All the kids, though, were playing games in the living room. I went in, and Sue, My brother, Ian, Claire, and Wyatt were there. We all started chatting and coloring until Mr. Bailey came in and announced that we all had to exercise, or something. He made Wyatt do  push-ups. I sneaked out to put my dress on, but it had gone. Then I woke up."
628," Last night I was dreaming that we were having some kind of party in the living room and that there was some kind of difficulty going on. I think we were going to watch a movie and have the sound system on, and the VCR wasn’t working or something, and there was some kind of commotion about somebody dropped a glass of water. It was very vague. And then, since the VCR wasn’t working and we couldn’t watch the movie, then I decided I was going to set up the mixer board and stuff, and I like, I think I dropped a glass tube of some kind and it shattered all over the floor. And then I could finally sit down and eat the taco thing, and I don’t remember too much else. That was dumb."
629,"I dreamed that I was in the snack bar. Everyone in there was fast asleep, so I attempted to sleep too. I remember I was in between Lou and Albert. Lou and I were talking, and then he started to kiss me. I was annoyed because I was pretty sure that he didn't think he was kissing me. I pushed him away but he kept kissing me. Then I left and had to be Santa's elf or something and help build the sleigh. Lou began to get sick, so I have him some cheese to help him feel better. We finally finished the sleigh, and then I woke up."
630,"I had a dream that I was in the main building holding a key. I knew it was a key to get into one of the dorms, only on, the one I lived in. I walked out to Langton because it was closest and tried my luck there. The key opened the door and I was thrilled, until I saw about  boys draped all over the furniture. They told me that I didn't live there I was so scared I went back to the main building. I tried to figure out my schedule, which I didn't have, as usual. I can't really recall all the details, but I remember waking up and thinking that it was an ""outrageous dream about school."""
631," I had a very strange dream last night. I dreamt that I was going on a date with Doug Houghton to a baseball game, and the thing was, Doug worked at a restaurant near the Dome, so he could just stay at the baseball game and watch. But I, with the sound things, and I was going to kind of show him what I did, but we ended up eating lunch at this restaurant there and it was like a walk-through buffet like pizzeria thing. And you would go through and you would get some pizza and you’d get some other finger foods, and then you’d go in this ____________ for your drink. Well, I think for a minute Doug Houghton turned into Dad and he got me this like sushi soup type of stuff, and I was “Yuk” when I had my eyes on some pizza or some chicken fingers or something like that, and I didn’t even have time to get a drink. So then we walked down a ramp that led like right into the baseball field, and ___________ and somehow I finished my yuk soup. And then I drift into another scene and I’m walking along with Dad, and I’m up on the second floor where I do my DJ stuff at Gate One. And it’s dark, and it’s like in the middle of the night and there are only a few lights on in there. And there’s a spotlight like from the ceiling shining down to the first _____ like right in front of where I would work. And the floor up on the balcony is like _____ in linoleum instead of carpet, and it was kind of strange. I was thinking, “Man, do I have to set up in this total darkness?” And it wasn’t really a scary darkness, because darkness isn’t scary; it’s just a wide open like familiar space. I’m comfortable in the dark. And then I think all the offices were dark and locked up. And then there was – I don’t remember – going somewhere out to the truck, and then I woke up."
632,"My first dream was that I was playing an ice hockey game and all my senior friends had come back to watch, like Aidan, Nick, Anthony, and others. I also remember other faces like Aaron. My stick kept switching from a lefty to a righty, and it was horribly frustrating. We won the game and after I got undressed and changed, I went to the stands to say hi to everyone. I started crying because I had missed them all so much. Then, all of a sudden, everyone disappeared except for Aidan. We sort of started walking towards each other, and then he started crying! And then he disappeared too! I was so sad. That night I went home and had to give this show about a horse. It was  and I was showing this horse. Then I saw Aidan crying. I ran to him in the room at soccer camp where we watch movies. He kept saying, ""You don't understand,"" and then I woke up."
633," Last night I had a pretty goofy dream. Well, it’s not really goofy, but still…. I dreamt that I was back in my high school again, and I was there like on an extra day, an extra day like after school had ended or something. And I was at this luncheon with the Spanish Honor Society people. Can’t remember what I was doing with them, but I was just having lunch, I think going to MacDonalds or something. Then I came back to the school and was helping out with the awards ceremony, and then we were out in the bus lane waiting for this city charter bus to come and pick us up and take us all home, kind of like when we were at the Wilcox Center waiting for our cabs. So we were all at this bus lane, this girl named Astrid was showing me her award and telling me about various things, and then the city bus comes and I get right in front for some reason, and it’s going to take us all home just like a school bus would, except it’s not. All of a sudden the cell phone rings and it’s Mom and Dad wanting to know why it’s : o’clock and we’re not home yet, and I told them all the things I’ve been doing and it’s impolite to make a call on the cell phone during the assembly. And so, of course, that didn’t go over too well. So I got home and sitting at the dining table and Dad’s asking me to explain why I didn’t call sooner and all. And I’m sitting there and I’m at this placemat thing that ______ for papers and we ran out of them, sitting there typing with my fingers as though there were a keyboard there, but there wasn’t, just a placemat. I’m sitting there typing away, but there’s like nothing . That was dumb. And Dad comes over and he’s like, “I’m sorry, I can’t read that draft.” And so then I get the drift, and I start writing it all down. And before I can finish, I woke up."
634,"I had a dream that I was babysitting my brother and we were watching movies. We were watching the Star Wars trilogy. When it was over, he wanted to watch Pocahontas. We were in something I remember as a ""public living room."" Other people walked in and this one girl had a huge crush on my brother. When I was done babysitting him, I had to go babysit the Pike children in Post. When I was there, it started to snow. Mr. Pike got home as I was unloading the dishwasher. He paid me and let me go. Then school started. I had to go to a Spanish class that was somewhere else. I was packing my backpack to go, and all these people kept taking my stuff and pestering me, so it was impossible to pack. I must have woken up and then begun a new dream. I was one of the friends of the Culkin family. Also in this group was Aidan. We all got really drunk and started walking on this bridge, complaining how adults never understand kids. We were all planning for a surprise party or something...Aidan was meant to guard the door while we all set up. But then I woke up."
635," Last night I had a really bizarre dream. I dreamt that this doctor had to come out and examine Mom because to prove that she was not medically capable of playing real drums because one of those ____ drums not really accepted by the music community very well. They were kind of frowned upon like artificial or fake. So and one of the _____ really accept the fact that this was necessary. And they had the doctor come up and prove that she couldn’t really do it the right way, and then they would let her use a key-based knee  type of thing. And there was this one particular type of drum set that you had to lay down on the floor and like kick your feet and use your hands in order to do them. Oh my gosh, in my dream she was like  years old and couldn’t even try to do that. That was odd."
636,"I dreamed that I was attending soccer camp again. Hannah and Sue were there. We were all having so much fun and looking forward to the next weekend when we'd go to Hannah's house. It was then Friday and we were done with camp. We were all walking towards Hannah's car, when all the younger campers practically killed us by kicking their soccer balls at us. We loaded our bags into the car and went to Hannah's house. I remember us all showering when we got there. Then I wandered around the house into a beautiful Renaissance style living room where two people were having sex. It was really weird, so I left and then woke up."
637,"Well I have had sleep paralysis for years, hardly ever have it anymore, which sucks because I actually enjoy the experience now, it's no longer scary. Let me preface by saying; after this was over, I immediately went back to sleep, instead of getting up to document it so I did lose some of it. Anyway I was up from Friday morning at  until  Sunday morning. So close to  hours. I went to bed knowing I would probably have a sleep paralysis episode upon falling asleep because I was so sleep deprived . What do you know I immediately fell into one. I caught myself paralyzed and having trouble breathing. I immediately realized what was up, and calmed myself down, leveled out my breathing. I figured this would be a great time to try to go out of body. I remember trying to leave my body a few times and being unable to. Then I opened my eyes and could see the room. I do sleep with a sleep mask on, which makes it all the more interesting. I remember looking up at the ceiling and seeing this image that was moving. It looked like the shadows of all these bugs crawling around. At first it freaked me out, but then I reminded myself what was going on and that they weren't real. Immediately the bugs changed to what looked like leaves, it reminded me of fall. Then I remember once again trying to raise up out of my body. I succeeded and felt myself float up towards the ceiling. Once I got the to ceiling I didn't seem to be able to go through it. I moved over to the wall, which had some sort of pattern on it, that really isn't there. And moved along to the window. I was able to move through the window and was on the outside of my building. I looked down towards the  floor remembering that I knew a neighbor down there, and wondered if I could get into his place and actually see him sleeping. Something however distracted me and I was suddenly back in my bed, although still asleep. Throughout this whole experience I would have moments where my breathing would become short and it was hard to get in air, but I was always able to get past it. That is the WORST feeling, if it weren't for that SPs would be GREAT! So I want to try to leave my body once more, and before I do I see lights flashing on my ceiling. They look like lights a cop car would make. I float up to the ceiling again and then move out the window. I look down and I am over about  police officers who were all standing over someone who seemed to be injured or dead. This freaked me out, I immediately wanted to wake myself up to see if that was really going on outside. Upon thinking that I forced myself to wake, and did so immediately. Went over to the window and nothing was going on. Checked the clock, it had been about  minutes since I had gone to bed. It was quite a lucid and exciting experience, way more then I can describe here. One I won't forget. "
638,"I dreamed that my father was having dinner with Matthew, Albert, and Anthony. They were going to a sleepover later. I wanted to shower before they arrived. Halfway through my shower, I thought I heard them, so I got out and went downstairs. For some reason, Camilia had come and wanted to shower too, so I let her shower while I watched TV. When she was done, I remembered that I hadn't conditioned my hair or anything, so I went back in. When I got out of the shower for the  time, all the boys were there. They began rolling out sleeping bags and mattresses, preparing for the sleepover. Then I must have woken up and started a new dream. This dream I can't remember exactly, except that Hannah, Sue, and I were mad at this other girl."
639," Last night I dreamt that Linda was wanting to come over for  of July and go down to the street dance type thing with us on the weekend and enjoy the dance and things at midnight. She wanted to be sitting down in my studio remembering all of our people overseas. And then I realized that it was something like July  or  and that  of July was last weekend. And then I kind of found out that Linda and her family had kind of hired the downtown, the band and everybody to have another  of July party and act like it was  of July. And so I was there with her, and I don’t remember too much. But we were walking around and listening to the band. I dreamt that it was a beefed up version of my Peavey system and I hired somebody to work the board so I could walk around with her. And what else? I also dreamt that I was going into – I had this teddy bear that was like a s_____ teddy bear, and he had a lavalier microphone attached to a long wire, and it was kind of like, kind of attached in some way. And I wanted to replace it, and I also, I can’t remember what else, but I went in and I took care, I wanted an adaptor, so I ran and I took care of that. Then I realized I didn’t have my purse or anything with me, so I ran back out to the truck, and, of course, running is like barely even walking in a dream. And then I woke up before I could do anything."
640,"I dreamed that I was at soccer camp again. Charles was one of my counselors and he kept teasing me, in a good way, I guess. Every time I tried to take a picture of him, he would duck or run away. I finally took one of him as we were walking indoors to eat lunch and watch the movie. Inside they were serving lunch  to us. Everyone kept saying, ""It's OK, we have  hours before we have to run again. So I ate some. Then it got dark, as the movie was about to start. I started to fall asleep. When I woke up, everyone was unplugging the lamps. It was really weird, because it was already dark. Then I woke up."
641,"I dreamed that it was the end of the year and all the seniors were about to graduate. Sue and I were preparing for our exams. It was the night before graduating; so all the seniors were playing games while all the underclassmen were studying. I remember looking into a room and seeing Nick and another girl, which made me jealous. I forget what Nick said, but I left, furious. Sue and I didn't have the proper materials to study for the chemistry exam. We snuck into the science building to get the stuff. When we got there, there was some sort of leak or something, because the whole building was flooded and smelled awful. Sue and I grabbed buckets to carry everything. We swam through the hallways trying to find a light switch. We couldn't, so we returned to the main building. All the seniors were getting ready to leave, and I was so sad and flustered because I didn't think I would see any of them again. Then I saw Anthony and he hugged me and kissed me goodbye. Then I must have woken up and started another dream about The Da Vinci Code. I remember the albino monk, Silas, was trying to kill someone else, and I was trying to stop him. The man Silas was trying to kill came to me for help. He wanted me to disguise him. So I cut him a pair of jeans. I guess I thought that would disguise him. I kept waking up in the middle of the night though."
642,"I dreamed that it was the beginning of school. Even though I was supposed to be rooming with Hannah, I had to spend the first night of study hall with my old roommates, Zoey and Maria. I was really annoyed, but I knew that if I spent just one study hall with them, I never would have to again. I think it was probably nearing the end of study hall, because I was feeling really impatient to leave. Then I must have woken up and started a new dream. In this dream, I was at this summer camp. Sue was there and we were having a lot of fun. On the last day, we had to board buses to get us home. One kid was frantically telling us that when we got on the bus, they were going to give us an oxygen mask because of the altitude. Only it was a gas mask and if we put it on, we would die. Sue and I got on and held our masks to our faces, pretending we had them on. We saw a lot of kids put them on and then ""fall asleep."" We closed our eyes to pretend. The bus stopped and everyone who was alive got out, while they cleaned all the dead bodies off. Sue and I stood outside the bus, crying. When we got back on, they were going to gas the whole bus. I just remember thinking, ""This is it, no one will know I'm dead for a long time. I can never see my family or friends again."" But just as we were about to board the bus again, a volcano erupted, causing everyone to scatter. I ran all the way home and then woke up."
643," This is a dream tape that I am recording from another state, or at least this is where I’m going to start it anyway. This is August , three or four days into my vacation, sitting around at Christine’s house and nobody’s home at the present time, or at least I don’t think – maybe Josie and Bobby are still hibernating, but I don’t think anybody else is awake and home. Last night I dreamt that, first of all, I was back in my home state and I was back at my high school, but then again I had the feeling that I really wasn’t supposed to be there, but I had the feeling that it was extra. And Mr. Johnson, my boring PE teacher, was having me do this report, and in the locker room there were these little match books with people’s names and numbers on them, like famous people. And he would give you a number of a person he would want you to do a report on, and you would go to these match books in the locker room and find the correct number of the person, and _____ the match book with some references that you go to, I guess. And he was going to give me this person to do that was #, but he wanted me to wait and come back the next day and ask him what number it was. And so the next day I slept in until :, and I had to skip school in order to give this gift back to WM&F and I had gotten some gifts from somebody in my dream that was like a little address book that I couldn’t really see that well, and some pencils and some other little diddly things, and I was going to put it in a basket and donate to WM&F, I guess, to sell in a fundraiser or something, or like a _____ gift, I guess. I was going to skip school so that I could go do that. Well, I was laying in bed listening to Lionel Richie on the bedroom machine, and Cooper, Christine’s big dog, was there, and I was ______ I was laying with him and I was holding onto him like he was a person, and he was like laying his head on my shoulder and like kind of licking my ear or something. And I knew I had to get up, but I really didn’t want to. And then I looked out the window and I saw Dad in the back yard and I was a little embarrassed. And then I woke up."
644,"First I dreamed that my friends and I were all trying to help Matthew get into Yale. We were helping him with classes and applications. I think he ended up getting in, but then I started a new dream that was really weird. I had three bedrooms, and whenever I had to talk to someone, they always met me in the wrong room. My next dream was about taking exams. I dreamed that right before each exam in the morning, we all gathered in the dining hall and individually ordered French toast and bacon. The woman got angry because she didn't want to cook. I was slightly confused. My last dream was about this game. There were  people and  killer. Everyone is trying to find out who this one killer was before they died. They were all forming pacts and groups, just to be betrayed. It was really odd. Then I woke up."
645,"My first dream was that I was at a meeting for soccer preseason. All the seniors were talking about how much fun it was, and all the freshmen were looking really scared, but I wasn't. Then I started a new dream. I was in Bundy and Lou was in Owen. I really wanted to see him, but I needed an excuse to run over there. I saw someone delivering a pizza, so I decided I would sneak in when the pizza delivery guy went in. I scooted inside and went to my friend's room  then I went looking for Lou. But it was Anthony I found. He kissed me and then I woke up."
646,"Last night I dreamed that I was at the Dunn’s house and Sue, Hannah, Kim and I were all taking the SATs. We were all discussing our answers, which was apparently OK. When we were done, we left to go home. I lived somewhere else. We saw tollbooths and drove through them, but immediately after we entered, all the cars changed directions and they were heading towards us! Horrified, I turned the car around. Then for some reason, we were looking for Anthony to surprise him. He was living in Texas, and when we got down there, people were throwing sand at his house; however, this was considered a gesture or admiration or something like that. Then I started a new dream where Ed was having lunch. Weird. Then I woke up."
647," Last night I had a dream that I was back home again, and I was on my s_____ upstairs and we had somehow I was getting to have all these tons of things on my hard drive, and I needed the space for audio and I didn’t know how these things were getting on there. And I, you know how sales people call sometimes and they solicit their marketing and stuff? Well, this girl called the house and she was selling things, and I started asking her a bunch of questions about things and she didn’t really know the Mac platform that well, but she knew about things ____ and I thought that maybe the fact that the beautiful angel statue’s wing cracked off, I thought that maybe that was screwing up my system somehow. And I told her that, and, of course, she probably thought I was crazy. And she decided she was going to come over to the house to see what I was talking about, and to help me out, and then I kind of, I went online somewhere, which is something I can’t do, and I was trying to download some kind of audio or something, but instead this green dinosaur was getting downloaded and opened and all, and I couldn’t close it. I couldn’t do anything. I had to do a restart to get out of that. And I couldn’t even do that. And then she came over and she was like hanging out in the house for two days, not really doing much. And then I can’t remember, I think we fixed my angel statue, and then her supervisor came, and he was a real nice man that actually knew what he was talking about, and he helped me delete all these things and I was telling him, “Okay, let’s shut down the right way this time.” And he said, “Okay, I’ll do it with the keys.” And he actually did it the way you do it for Windows, and I was starting checking on, I was, I guess I wasn’t sure what operating system I was using. And he did the Windows key, the ____ and the _____ just like they taught me at the Wilcox Center. And I think there’s more to it, but I woke up. I think this came from watching Bobby, how his setup is a little more different than ours, and he knew all these games and stuff. I guess that’s what I’m thinking of. "
648,"I dreamed that my family and I went to McDonalds every meal. All my friends did too. It was like school, or something, everyone went there everyday with his or her families. The McDonalds was owned by a really sweet man, so when he one day raised the prices, I didn't mind. Soon everything was really expensive, and we stopped going there. My next dream was that someone was trying to kill me. I wasn't being chased or anything like that, but someone was trying to kill me. When I was asleep , Lou came into my room. He started crying, and when I woke up he told me that he was the one who was trying to kill me. Then I was at the Lincoln Memorial and it was burning down. Then I woke up in real life."
649," I had a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad night because Mom wasn’t there; she was out with Larry. But people were still fussing around. Aunt Christine was at the kitchen table, putting packing tape and newspapers in a box, so you can imagine what that sounded like. And then there was all kinds of other stuff going on. And while all that was going on, I kind of fell asleep for maybe ten minutes and I had a dream that Aunt Christine and Mom were going to drive me over to Grandma’s house so that I could find a place to sleep. And so we got in her truck and we were driving, and we got there and it was turned into like a store. There were like racks of stuff there and her old carpet and things were still there, but it was all opened up and there was like this store and they were like selling like tourist gifts. And Grammy was there and she was like directing people around, and, of course, fussing like her usual self does. And there were no bedrooms there any more. And I think suddenly I was home in my home state in my room, and I had a feeling that it wasn’t really real, but I went up to my bed and I laid down and I turned on my unit that’s by my bed there, and it was so quiet that I had to bring it onto the bed next to me and like lay there and just it was okay. And I’m imagining this, but I just had the feeling that it wasn’t real, that none of this was real. And so then I knew I had to get back to Christine’s house, but I don’t know what, even though I was kind of going to sleep in my dream, I had to get back to Christine’s house. And I was just getting up and getting ready to go back there and then I woke up."
650,"I first dreamed that Sue, Lou, Tristan, and I were all in math class with Mr. Stipps again. We were all trying to find out this one problem, but it was nearly impossible. It was so frustrating. I guess Isabel and I finally gave up, or we figured it out or something, because we eventually left. We went to check our mail. I tried to open my mailbox, but it wouldn't open. I kept trying to open it, but it would just not open. Then Sue and I saw Mel Gibson coming to check his mail  and he laughed at us because we couldn't open mine. I then started a new dream where my family and I were driving somewhere. We were just driving along the hallway when, all of a sudden, I noticed no one was in the driver's seat. I felt really worried and tried to steer from the back seat. It was really difficult, and I ended up skidding off the road. My last dream was the best! It started badly though. I came home to find all the kids from the local high school having a party. Kylie was throwing the party, and I was really angry. Apparently my house was attached to one of the dorms by a long hallway. So everyone kept running back forth stealing stuff from the dorm rooms. Kylie found this tiny object that was like a kaleidoscope in the shape of a rock. It was brightly colored and she let me look at it. I looked through it and was surprised to see pictures of Anthony, waving, smiling, playing, laughing, reading, etc. I realized that this was the graduation present his parents had given him that he had been waiting to open. I was furious with Kylie for stealing it. I called Anthony and we started chatting and laughing. I kept walking through the hallway to Post, where Anthony lived, but Kylie kept running after me. She wanted the kaleidoscope because she thought Anthony was cute and wanted an excuse to talk to him. I got really mad and tried talking to Anthony through post-it notes. It was really weird. I kept talking to him and then he invited me to his room. He was teasing me crawled on top of me when I sat on his bed. He saw that I had his kaleidoscope and was so happy that he kissed me! Then I woke up."
651," I dreamt that I was staying in a hotel by myself that was like a few blocks from home in my home state because I was, there was a solo competition thing and I had to be there a few nights. And they had, I think Mom was there; we walked down there. And I forgot a few things and I was thinking how once they showed me around and once I got settled, I could always walk back . I forgot a few things, but I could still walk back to the house and get them. And I dreamt that, you know how they want me to have mobility and all, I dreamt that I was going to say that I forgot my cane, because I really did, but my motive for going back to the house and getting it was to get my CD player, which I forgot also. And I dreamt that this hotel was kind of pretty ornate. I don’t remember too much because it was a few days ago. And there was something else really interesting a few days ago, but, of course, I forgot. We’ve just been running and running and running and I have this dumb prepaid legal tape that I’m recording over, so I guess it can just run on and on and on, and it’s like blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Now I remember what I was going to say before. A couple nights ago I dreamt that I was back at my high school again and I was preparing for this school-sponsored trick-or-treat thing for kids, and I had boxes of like food and candy and stuff in my book bag, and it was all on a dolly, like a cart thing, that I was ready to just wheel down the elevator and go off to where I needed to go. I was like upstairs in front of the Guidance Office. So I had Angel watch it so that nobody would mess with it while I went to go get some things out of my locker and go do a couple other things. So I’m doing a couple other things and then I come back and all the stuff is gone off the dolly cart thing, and Mom is upstairs in front of the Guidance Office with her bicycle with all the boxes on it. And Angel’s like, “I stole your book bag” and she like threw it at me, you know, like they do sometimes. And I think Mom and I were going to go off to where we needed to go on the bicycle, but I don’t know how we were going to get down the stairs. And then I woke up."
652,"I dreamed that Charla and I were walking through the athletic center and we passed the boys' locker room. The doors were wide open and we could see all the boys inside. We went inside and started talking to them. For some reason, going into the boys' locker room was against the law, and Charla and I knew this, but we kept talking to all the boys . Suddenly, Mrs. Carter pulled us away and began lecturing us about how wrong it was to go into the boys' locker room. I soon fell asleep and had a dream within a dream. This dream was about shopping. I was in Costco shopping for food to keep into my dorm room at school, but then I got lost. I woke up and Mrs. Carter was still lecturing me. Then I really woke up in real life."
653," Last night I had the craziest dream that I’ve had in a while. Well, not really, but kind of. To start with I don’t know if I was up here or in my home state, but I was at this bar with Mom and a few other people, I think one or two of my friends too. And there was this machine there, this vending machine, that you would put a quarter in and you would put a square, rectangular piece of bendy plastic in. It was like three dimensional. And then the machine would play a tune like “Old MacDonald” or “London Bridge” or some kids’ song like that, while it was making the kid a figure. And it had like a little window where you could watch it through. And I can’t remember, it wasn’t scary, but the machine played “London Bridges” and “Blue Bird” and a couple other things like that, but some of them I couldn’t recognize. And I don’t know what that had to do with anything, but I also, at this bar I was supposed to set up the sound system and do something, record something, I guess. And I didn’t have the Peavey system; I had this big clunky thing. And somehow I made a recording with my voice talking over some music that’s playing and making some announcements and stuff. And later on I played it back on my personal CD player. And it was so loud, my voice was like clipping, and I couldn’t turn the volume down. It was like almost making me deaf, and it was like making my teeth rattle. And that was kind of crazy. And so I figured, “Next time I have got to pay more attention to the V meters, and they had these racks of equipment and they had a tape recorder, a CD recorder and a couple other things like the radio station does. And I had to stand on a chair and I still couldn’t see all the meters well enough. So then I kind of woke and went to a different scene. Then I fell back to sleep and I dreamt that Dad came up here. He drove up here and I had another week to go of vacation in my dream. And he kind of like surprised us like Uncle Bob did at the farm that one day. But it wasn’t a real pleasant surprise for me because this vacation is like supposed to be us away from home, and so he drove up here, and I thought, “Oh no, he’s going to be tagging along with us the next week and he’s going to rain on our parade.” And he also saying things like, “Well, we should drive home together when your week is up. You shouldn’t have to fly home. We should all drive home together.” And I was like, “Oh no,” that’s the worst thing I could hear because, you see, I’m so grateful that flying gets us there in a few hours, but driving takes days on end. And it’s like boring when it’s just the three of us. And somehow they made it out to be more of a hassle to fly than to drive, so I dreamt that we were going to lose some morning because we didn’t use our tickets, and we were going to have to drive home. And then I woke up, fortunately. Let’s see, I’m trying to remember. "
654,"I dreamed that I was taking Ancient Civilizations again with Mr. Bailey. I was re-writing an essay and I kept trying to email it to him, but it just wouldn't work. I kept getting the email returned to me. Frustrated, I went back to Bundy to see Hannah. It was snowing and all the heaters had broken up, so Katie and I huddled under our comforters, reading. We talked for a while before going to the main building to get dinner. On the way, I saw Matthew. I really wanted to talk to him, but was too shy. Hannah told me to just go up to him and say ""hi,"" so I did and he picked me up and twirled me around. He laughed, put me down, and started walking away. Hannah yelled across the hallway, ""See, Bea! It's so easy to talk to guys! I told you!"" I was embarrassed, but luckily Matthew didn't her. Julian, however, did. He began to laugh, but he didn't care. We went to the dining hall and saw Caroline and Sue. They were getting rice and singing the Goo Goo Dolls. Then I woke up."
655,"I dreamed that Lou was giving this speech in chapel about community service. He had to pick four people to help him. I raised my hand to ask a question, and he came over to me and said that I would be one of the four people to help him. Then I woke up."
656,"Dreaming that I'm at my mom's house. At one point I'm in her bed sleeping. I wake up and wonder why I'm in her bed. Everything is kinda hazy. Then I walk to my room, where I slept when I was a kid, and she was in my bed. So I went back to hers. Then I wake up again and am in my bed but still at my mom's house. This happens a few times. Finally I realize that I must be dreaming, although it doesn't dawn on me to get lucid. I just want to wake up because it feels like I am stuck in this false awakening cycle. I keep telling myself over and over to wake up, and finally I come to, very relieved. I hate that feeling."
657,"I don't remember full details other then the fact that we were in a plane and it was going to crash. I have a lot of airplane crash dreams. I do know we did end up crashing but no one was injured. Then in another part of the dream we are on a boat. It appears it is a boat my dad owns, but he isn't there my mom and I and some other people are on the boat. I go towards the back of the boat and find the bathroom. I started looking around at all this stuff in the boat, stuff of my dads. I had a sudden urge to go through it all, thinking I might find something important. I remember one other part of my dream where I am at my mom's house. I had woken up but it still felt like I was sleeping, I couldn't open my eyes all the way. I walk up to my mom and asked her to help me wake up. She pulled open both my eyes and suddenly I was able to see very clearly in the dream."
658,"Ok I was living in this house. Not sure if I bought it or what. It had this screened in porch in the front, looked very run down and trailerish. I saw that the door had a screen but it wasnt attached completely and if the cat got out it would be able to get through the door. I was able to zip the screen up around the door except for the bottom, if the cat was smart enough he would know he could squeeze underneath. I remember in the dream thinking I could buy some double sided velcro to secure the bottom. So Marley suddenly runs onto the patio, under the door, like I had feared, and out into the street. I run out after him and there is a gate I open it. I look out into the street screaming ""Marley Marley someone get him."" I am screaming this because I see someone walking down the street and am hoping she grabs him. Suddenly Marley is lifted up by the scruff of his neck and handed to me. But the person or thing that did this was invisible. They were with the other person obviously but I couldn't see them, which I thought was a bit odd, but I didn't question it. I was very happy to have Marley back. "
659,"I dreamed first that Sue and Hannah and I were all in Poland. We were walking around my high school  and saw Angelina at the auditorium. We all went in to watch a movie. Then, I dreamed that my father was up against  saber-toothed tigers, and that he defeated them all. Reporters from ESPN wanted to interview him. He kept saying things like, ""I'm da man,"" ""Who's your daddy?,"" and ""I'm in da house!"" My last dream was that Hannibal Lecter kidnapped me and he wanted to kill me. Then I woke up."
660,"I dreamed that I was running away from someone...but I can't remember exactly who it was. Then I was at soccer camp again and it was my birthday. I got to pick out a stuffed animal from a bag. Jon was there and had given me a Tiffany heart charm bracelet with my name engraved on it. Aidan had bought me dinner. The best part, though, was Anthony pushing through the crowd and taking me on a date to a swimming pool. We swam around all night and it was really warm. HE would lift me and carry me on his shoulders around in the water, all the while rubbing his hands across my skin. Then I started a new dream that my brother and I were in the library and we were standing in front of the Mona Lisa. Then I woke up."
661," I’m back from my trip, but I dreamt that I was still on my trip. First of all, the weirdest part, I dreamt that Elizabeth had this car that had this alarm thing that she didn’t know how to shut off, or else she couldn’t turn off unless she was going something like  or  miles an hour, so I think I was in Mr. Johnson’s PE locker room again. I keep having dreams about stuff like back at my high school, and I don’t understand it. So I was in Mr. Johnson’s locker room waiting for Elizabeth to pick me up, but yet I’m still on my trip. I don’t understand this notion. And there was like this indoor race track thing that Elizabeth was going to drive by and kick me up and go. And the thing of it was, she had to go as fast as she could and I had to jump in as fast as I could so that we could get to the  or so miles an hour she needed to shut the alarm off. That sounds like a movie to me. And so I’m waiting there and I don’t really remember her ever, I heard the car with the alarm going on because she had to slow down a little to get into the race track thing, and I like grabbed onto the door and like jumped in and slammed the door and we raced off. And I think we were going kind of slow, but she finally got the alarm to shut off. I couldn’t move around or anything. And then I dreamt that I was back in that locker room, and I had these pants, of all things, these pants that had an alarm on them. And how it would get activated is if you would touch the end of the belt strap to the belt buckle, that would complete some kind of circuit and it wouldn’t go off until you had the belt actually buckled. That was weird! Then I can’t remember – oh, I was at either Christine’s house or Larry’s house – I can’t remember which house. And we had all these aunties visiting us. And Dad was supposed to ride up on his bike any minute, I think, and come join the visiting party. And for whatever reason, I had a portable two-way radio, not in my pocket but literally stuffed down into my pants. I don’t know why, but I didn’t have to be actually keying the transmitter. There was this Auntie Lovely, Mom called her, who had another one, and supposedly was listening in on everything we were saying, and I didn’t actually have to be keying the transmitter to let her hear what was going on; it just transmitted by itself. And then, when we were sitting there visiting, Uncle Larry was setting up the boom box and just as he was setting it up, this Auntie Lovely lady is talking to me through the unit, and it’s real, real loud, and she’s saying that she’s almost there and she’s going to be here real soon, and not to cut the cake without her or something. And I was thinking, “Oh gosh, how embarrassing.” And I was hoping that they couldn’t tell it was actually me. I was hoping that they could just feel that the sound was like in the air or something. So I figure, “I have got to do something.” So I came in and I went into the bathroom, and I was going to like turn the volume down or turn that thing off or something, but then I kind of drifted into another scene. And this scene was that Mom and I had our car to drive up in my relative’s home town and I had made a CD of the blue Wee Sing tape with the “Blue Bird” song and everything on it. And for whatever reason, I had heard it three times earlier in the week and I wanted to play it again while we were driving around town. And so we did, and we were playing “London Bridges” and “Blue Bird” and all those other things while we were driving through town. And it wasn’t scary or anything. It was just that there were other relatives in the car and I didn’t want them thinking that I was a baby by wanting to play that. And I think shortly thereafter I faded into consciousness. Oh no, I didn’t. There was more to it. Oh my gosh, this goes on and on and on. I’m going to use up this tape. I dreamt that after driving all around and stuff, going home to my home state was just like a bicycle ride away, and so Mom and I were going to just ride the thing home. And we sat out there talking to Christine for another hour as if we really didn’t want to go home, but we knew we had to. And it was like : o’clock at night and we were still talking. And she gave us a blanket and a sheet and a little portable boom box machine that was actually like a kids’ thing that was shaped like a bunny rabbit. And Mom stuffed it in her bicycle basket and then we started bicycling home in the night. And that’s – oh, and I didn’t wake up yet. I dreamt that we got home and I was squished between Mom and Mrs. Dougherty on our porch swing, and we were telling her about her trip and some of the things that happened. And that’s when I woke up finally. Oh, that was just so weird. I mean, I can’t even begin to sort it out. I mean, I think, they always say that the subconscious is nowhere near as bridled as the conscious mind. I think my conscious mind is severely ridiculing my subconscious for coming up with such weird whacko ideas. But, you know, there must be a factor going on in me somewhere that I need to pay attention to, I mean, as bizarre it may be. One other thing, I don’t remember too much about the dream I was having last night, not last night but the night before when I slept downstairs on the air mattress, but I do remember, you know that thing that Mr. Romane taught us in  grade? It goes, “Fuzzy Wuzzy was a bear, Fuzzy Wuzzy had no hair, Fuzzy Wuzzy wasn’t fuzzy, was he?” That was a little song that he taught us, and he wanted us to move our hands up and down according to the intervals of the notes, and that, for whatever reason, kind of scared me – not in the dream, but in the class that he taught it to us did. And moving my hands up and down according to the notes made it feel worse because I couldn’t put my hands how I normally put them when something scares me like that. And in my dream a couple nights ago I dreamt that I was in a public bathroom and they were playing that over the intercom, and it wasn’t too much of a thing, but it was a little thing. And so I think half awake and half asleep, I turned over the way that I do. But I got the worst back ache and I realized that on that mattress it’s not good for me to lay like that. That was crazy!"
662,"I first dreamed that I was in Florence, because that is where my parents were getting married . Either I was really sick or sad, because someone gave me a huge cake. I remember falling asleep in my dream and being awoken to crashing noises and explosions. I looked out my window, and people were running and screaming everywhere. It was weird though; they were all celebrating for something, rather than screaming about something bad. I was frustrated because I couldn't find anyone I knew and I had no idea what everyone was screaming about. Then I must have begun a new dream because all of a sudden I was at the spring carnival. Everyone was having a lot of fun as usual --Jello-wrestling, slip-and-sliding, and everything else --I can't remember a lot of details, but then everyone went to the dining hall. I was eating strawberries with sugar. Across the dining hall, Leah was strutting around on a table. She got embarrassed and tried to make it a joke, but no one laughed. Then I woke up."
663," Okay _______ is short and sweet. Last night I had a dream that I was in this elevator with Elizabeth and a couple people from the Wilcox Center. It was really big, and had these glass windows kind of like the ones from the pier. And I had the notion that we had to get to the  floor of this building and we were kind of stuck, and we had to kind of ride up and down for a little while until somebody called it from the  floor and got it to open. And down below there were these people bouncing balls in a courtyard. We were looking through the elevator windows and we saw. And I kind of shifted to another scene that I was like with the transition people, and I had these raw cucumber slices and I like put them up against my eyes and kind of squinted to hold them there, to get kind of goofy like they do in the cartoons, because I used to do stuff like that when I was little. And they got so offended, thinking that I was making fun of myself and people who had terminal legal blindness. And I don’t know where all that came from. It was small, but it was kind of crazy. So anyway, I think I did a pretty good job of filling up this tape. For once I will have timed it so that I’m done when it’s done. Now I can finally take off that little piece of scotch tape that I put on the one side to let me record over this “blah, blah, blah” tape, and I can take the tape off and it’ll just be a regular tape. Anyway, you know what I’m saying. "
664,"I got in bed at : fell into sleep paralysis immediately. When I woke up it was : so it lasted about  minuets. Felt like it too. Immediately I was aware and awake yet my body was asleep. It was typical sleep paralysis. Now I am at the point though where I can control it and it doesn't bother me. I was highly aware this time. Initially it felt like I couldn't breath, as it always does, but once I relaxed and reminded myself not to worry about that feeling and that I could breath, it eased up. However throughout this experience my breathing kept bothering me and I would have to remind myself. The other thing that happened that has NEVER happened before is I could hear myself breathing, it was very loud and it sounded as if my breathing was labored. I felt tingling all over my body and it felt like my arms and legs were being pulled. I attempted to leave my body at this point but I was not able to. As I was in this state I suddenly hear what sounds like a radio station, I hear it chyrstal clear, then it switches to another, I must have heard at least  and some were commercials, some were songs, etc. I was trying hard to listen for a call letter of a radio station or something but didn't get one. I can tell you I have no doubt I was actually somehow plugged into a radio frequency and truly could hear this stuff. It was so vibrant and clear. Very unique experience it happened once before but never to that extent. I also remember looking up at the ceiling, also I had a night mask on because light bugs me. Anyway so I am looking at the ceiling and I see this pattern develop on the ceiling and start to move in a circular motion. Then I realize it was me who was moving in the circular motion not the ceiling. I felt the force of the movement and it felt very cool. This is something I had never experienced either. I do remember hearing this really lound crackling, I have left my body before and heard a buzzing but this was more of a crackling like if someone had some large sticks and were breaking them in front of a very loud microphone. It was weird. Then I felt myself kinda of swaying back and forth, I wasn't doing this consciously, I kinda caught myself doing it. And realized that you can ROLL out of your body. So I go with the rocking and start to rock harder. Finally I feel myself roll over. I look down at my bed and can see the bedspread, I can see the pattern and it looks like the fibers in the bedspread are alive. I get off my bed and turn around to see if I can see my body. And I don't. This was confusing because I knew I should. Although I then realize that the bed looks different too, so maybe I am no longer in my room. I float over to my bookshelves and then around the apartment. It was definitely much different then where I really live, go figure. I was having trouble seeing clearly and I was trying to make things more vibrant, I would say ""Clarity Now"" but nothing. Then I remembered I had my sleep mask on and I wondered if the fact that it was blocking out light from my eyes was why I was seeing everything so darkly. So I reach up, or so I thought, and remove my mask. Things brighten up only slightly.  I am in some other house now, it's very beautiful, nice furniture and architecture. I fly through the window and try to conjure up a beach and ocean but no luck. Now I am back in my body on the bed again but still in the sleep paralysis state. I am back to hearing radio stations, I also distinctly hear what sounds like a tv show, like a game show. Then I hear a very young girl  say: ""Energy is..."" I'm thinking, Energy is what? That sounded important, why didn't she finish. I listened more and got other radio stations but no more little girl. I could hear my cat playing in the back ground the whole time as well, and I heard why my air conditioner shut on and off. A couple times I remember hearing myself actually make noise when something interesting happened. Once I woke up the biggest thing that stuck in my mind was this little girl saying Energy is... It seemed significant. Then it dawned on me she was just saying ""Energy Is!"" that was the whole statement. Which makes sense because energy is! LOL It exists, it always has it always will, it is! Well that's what I got from it. It was a really really neat experience. I woke up and  minutes had past. :)"
665,"I dreamed that I was at the beach and was swimming against Rachel. I had to swim from one dock to another, so I dove in and touched the bottom. Immediately, I felt like I couldn't breathe. I struggled to the surface, feeling the pressure on my lungs. It was really scary and I kept pushing upward. Finally I reached the surface and gulped air in. I was breathing really hard in real life and woke myself up for a second. Then when I fell back asleep I was walking home from the beach in my comforter. I was so tired I could barely stand up. It started raining and this little boy appeared carrying an umbrella and he kept me dry. When I got to my house, I asked him his name. It was Colin. So I got home and Kylie called asking me to help her on her math placement exam. I really didn't want to, but she kept begging me, so I couldn't just hang up. So then Sue drove up and asked me if I wanted to go with her to the mall and then to the movies. I really wanted to go with her, but Kulie wouldn't stop bugging me, so Sue drove off. I was really mad. Then the power went out and I couldn't turn my computer on."
666,I remember one scene where I was riding in the car with my mom and dad. I remember mentioning something about how my dad and I used to get along  and how I was glad we were friends now. I could feel a feeling of love towards him in the dream. Another scene was more from third person I was watching these people in a boat at the ocean and they were trying to get past the breaking waves. Finally the boat over turned and they had to walk to sore.
667,"Last night I had a very odd dream that there was this huge concert on the quad. There was a stage, a crowd, and everything. It was right in the beginning of the year, so everyone was really excited and energetic. I was sitting next to Gianna and we got called up on stage. When we got there, it started to shake uncontrollably, like some kind of trampoline. Everyone was laughing and cheering as we struggled to stay upright. We finally got off and walked inside Langton so I could go to the bathroom. I saw Lou and Ariana washing dishes. They had just seen my ""performance"" and were being really critical of it. Ariana said that when she saw me, she wanted to vomit. Lou laughed and then --to my horror --agreed. He was going out with Vanessa, and Ariana was discussing that now with Lou. I ran to the other end of the dorm and began to cry. I hated him for agreeing with Ariana, and I hated myself for liking him. On the opposite end of the hall was a movie theater. I went inside to watch Finding Nemo. There was a guy with flowers waiting for me; he was oddly reminiscent of Anthony. We began to chat and laugh, and soon Lou was out of my mind. When the movie was over, we walked out of Langton to find the campus deserted. We entered another dorm to find lots of people crammed inside. All the students were doing ridiculous chores and exercises as punishment from the teachers for having the huge concert. We ran out and into another dorm to avoid being caught and made to mow the grass with our teeth, or duel each other with umbrellas. We ran upstairs to my room. We could hear a teacher frantically pursuing us. I had the topmost loft as my room, only accessible by a leader, which unfortunately had been shattered. We tried in vain to climb up, but it was useless. We were caught and led downstairs where we were forced to drive metal pegs into the ground. Then I woke up."
668,"I dreamed that I belonged to this very prestigious book club. Pauline was there and so was Brenda. We were all discussing a book we had just read. All of a sudden, the floor turned to ice. We were in a huge mansion, and all the oriental rugs were turned to ice. Then the ice started to crack and all the chairs fell through to the freezing water below. I was so scared, but then I woke up."
669,"I dreamed that I was on some trip somewhere and I was driving a huge coach bus with all my friends in it. Since I was driving, I was the one who decided where we stop for bathroom breaks and stuff. No one could agree with me about when and where to stop though, so I became frustrated and finally stopped at a rest area. I saw a little boy who looked lost. He spoke Spanish, so I said, ""Donde es el coche?""  But then I remembered that I had to use estar instead of ser. So I corrected myself and said ""Donde esta; el coche?"" A man nearby told me that the only way the little boy would find his way home is if I brought him to the church at the end of the mall at the rest area. I asked, ""Donde esta la iglesia?"" A woman told me she would lead me there. So I picked the little boy up and walked behind the woman. On the way I saw Ava; she had been shopping. She showed me a black tank top she had bought from Express. She asked if I wanted to borrow any of her money to shop, but I said no. Then I woke up."
670,"I had this horrible dream that we were playing a hockey game. Our third line  was completely out of it, and we just couldn't play. One girl was missing from the first line, so Chloe moved me up to play with them --big mistake! They were much faster and more skilled than I. I would try to pass the puck, and they'd be gone from the space I'd passed to. I couldn't position myself correctly because they would always skate away. Finally the game ended; we had won, and Chloe and Mrs. Carter were thrilled. Everyone then left and I was alone on the bench. Then all the lights went out. I began to take off my equipment right then and there. Doing so, I managed to lose my gloves, pants, and skates. When I finally had put what was remaining of my equipment into my bag, I assumed that my skates had somehow magically been transported to the locker room. I must have started a new dream, because next thing I know I am talking to Anthony. And it's weird because I know somewhere in the back of my mind that he's dead. But I kept talking to him. I was so sad because he was dead. But then I woke up."
671,"I dreamed about a Justin Timberlake concert, a premiere for a Kate Hudson movie, and some dumpster. I can't remember any other details."
672,"I can only remember that Lou, Matthew, and I were on a deserted island somewhere. Matthew and I were going to see Lou, but he was flying an airplane made of cloth overhead. There was a girl with him, and I became sort of sad. Then I woke up."
673," This morning I just had a bizarre kind of dream. Well, first of all, at night I dreamt that I was walking in a park and doing some kind of stuff with Mom and Dad, and I had this thing – I don’t remember what it was – but then my thing came on to wake me and I was hearing the dove while I proceeded on with this dream of mine. And then I was still asleep and dreaming, but I felt that I was laying here in my bed. And, as I was dreaming, essentially I was asleep, but I didn’t know it, so I was dreaming that my hand could reach over and change it to . like I like to hear in the morning. But since I was sleeping, I had that tactile sensation, but I really wasn’t doing it, so I didn’t hear any audio feedback that that was happening. And I was sleeping still. I didn’t actually physically get up, but in my dream I did. I got up and I looked at it, and it was even showing me the numbers of where it was going instead of the time. But I just didn’t hear it because it was still on the dove and I was still …. "
674,"I had a dream that I met the kids on The O.C. Granddaddy lived in one of the dorms and I had to take a roller coaster to get there. When I got there, there was an itinerary that told me when I would be getting my teeth pulled out. I wasn't aware of this and was thoroughly frightened. Then we had some tribute dedicated to Keira Knightley because she had died. When cars passed by, they would honk out of respect. Then I woke up."
675,"I dreamed that Caroline and Claire were playing soccer on the quad with Samantha. Lou was walking me back to Owen, for some reason. It was really nice out. Then I woke up."
676,"I had a really gory dream last night. Sue and I worked for the CIA and we both had some special  sense. The CIA would tell us general areas where someone had been murdered, and we would have to go scout around for either the murderer or the dead body. It was really scary because the killer could be anywhere, and Sue and I were the only ones who could see the body. We had special equipment and everything. It was traumatizing to see the bodies. I remember seeing the lower half of a body with knives stuck in the legs. It was horrible. Thank God I woke up!"
677,"I had a dream that David and Kathy were playing soccer on the quad. I was in Bundy and stole a Lily Pulitzer gift card from Jules. Then I went to Rome, but woke up."
678,I dreamed that Sue and I were in a fight. We were in some Hallmark store and I was frustrated that Kylie would talk to Sue and not me. Sue was ignoring me. We were watching soccer on TV in this little store and I was looking for nice journals to give to Sue for her birthday. Then I woke up.
679," What was I going to say? Oh, I get a little flustered sometimes; can you tell? This is a tape that used to be something boring that came in the mail that had a Braille label and I managed to rip it off, and I used this tape for me and ____ to goof around, as you could hear at the beginning. And so now I’ve got ample space left and I can’t bear to just waste it, so I’m going to use it for some more dreams. I had the neatest one last night. First of all, let me start off like this, this is one of the bizarre parts. I dreamt that Celine’s song, “Prayer”  it starts off and the two verses go on just like they’re supposed to, but in my dream there was no third verse and that magical key chain that she does in most of her songs. It was a car commercial in place of it. Can you believe it? And that’s how I dreamt that it was recorded, and there was just nothing, it was like a big disappointment. And then I dreamt that I can’t remember where I was or what I was doing – but I was at this building – I think it was a school or an office building or something; I can’t remember what. But I needed to get on this elevator, and it was kind of a scary one because the building was twelve stories and I needed to go up to the  floor, so I hit # and we got there surprisingly fast. And I can’t even remember what I was doing. Come to think of it, I think it was the Dome. I had to get up to the very top to do something with the sound board or something. And so I was at # and then I needed to get back down because I left my papers with the receptionist. And I got in the elevator and I needed to go ten stories down, and I hit # and I didn’t grab the railing, and it just started to drop rapidly. And it’s one of those things where you feel like you’re falling and your reflexes make you physically jump and sometimes make you wake up. Well, I didn’t wake up, but I felt myself jump, and I grabbed the railing and then I was okay, but it was like, “Ahhhhh,” free-fall. And that was really scary because I could feel myself getting closer and closer to the ceiling and then grabbed the railing and then I was okay. So I got down, and I had the feeling like the door wasn’t going to open immediately, but it did. And you know what was fascinating, there was so much more to do, but I can’t remember. I let the day get away from me because I was putting this off."
680,"I dreamed that Camilia, Ed, and I were all jumping on mattresses in the main building. They asked me to join them, but I didn't want to. I went to the dining hall to make a cup of tea. Mrs. Frank was there and wanted me to babysit, but I really didn't want to. So I hurried to make my tea. Then I went to the back of the dining hall, and there was this Harry Potter game open and there was a scary monster in it. I wanted it to leave, but it wouldn't. It was terrible! Then I woke up."
681," We’d just come home from our trip and last night I had a bizarre dream. I was in a bunk bed, if that had any effect on anything. First of all, I dreamt that I had to retake my AP test, and it wasn’t the Spanish test; it was more of a test of the usage of English grammar and spelling, but mainly on what words had certain implications. And for some reason I had the notion that that test brought on a lot of feelings of pain and sadness and fear and all like that in me because in my dream I had the notion that I took the test a few years ago and I think I missed a question or two or three, and somebody who was giving the test wanted to give me a chance to redo it. And it was on a pink sheet of paper, but I had to put my new answers on the white sheet, just these three questions. And on the pink sheet were a couple of multiple choice questions at the top. Then, you know how Spanish verb conjugations have six lines going vertically down? Well, on these six lines, there were three sets of six lines, and on the first set of six lines I had to write, “Oh, do you know the Muffin Man, the Muffin Man, the Muffin Man? Oh do you know the Muffin May that lives on Dreary Lane?” And on the next set of lines I had to write, “Oh yes, I know the Muffin Man,” and on and on. And on the last set I had to write, “Now we all know the Muffin Man.” And I think there were one or two other things like that, and I had the notion that you were supposed to spell “do” like, “Do you know the Muffin Man” “d-e-w” and I was going to have something major wrong on the test because I didn’t spell it that way, but I wasn’t sure, so I left it. And I answered a few of the multiple choice questions about certain words, but they were like whacko questions. I can’t remember them exactly, but it asked about the odd meaning of odd words with kind of a strange implication factor. And I dreamt that I was telling somebody that having to finish that test brought back a lot of pain that I felt when I took the test that I all forgot about. And it wasn’t necessarily just a fear, but it was a fear-sadness type of a thing. And I don’t know what all that’s about; that was weird. But somehow I felt, I woke up in the middle of the night because the air conditioner was too cold, and then I went back to sleep, and dreamt that it was Halloween and it was : o’clock in the evening. I had no candy to give out except for a little bag. I had no sound system on the porch because Mom kept putting off and putting off getting on her bike and going to get some candy from the supermarket. Dad was putting off and putting off going to the garage and fixing the Peavey system. So I dreamt that not only did I have to set up the Peavey system and all its parts, but I had to set up the CD thing and the wireless mic and everything all in about ten minutes, and I was feeling really, really overwhelmed. And there were these two teenage boys already ding-donging the doorbell and trick-or-treating. And I just barely had something to give them and a few decorations out. And then that was that. I faded into another scene that I was re-recording over the lullaby tape because the last song had accompaniment but no words. And I dreamt that I could just put the tape in and hit “record” and the recorder would automatically mix the new increment signal with the old. And it was a song that goes,  “Golden slumber then you’ll rise, ________ away to ________. Sleep pretty baby, do not cry, and I will sing a lullaby.” But anyway, I was re-recording that and then I faded into consciousness. I sort of had the notion that I had really don that, and I was realizing that I should have first copied the tape sound track accompaniment onto a CD RW, then mixed it with my mixer with my voice and recorded that mix onto the tape, not just the voice. And somehow I had the notion that that was all correlated, and the taking the test thing really had an impact on me. I mean, I didn’t really feel it, but I sort of did. And I wondered have I taken any tests lately that have had some subtle implications that have blocked some subconscious things on, or what’s the deal here? So that’s that. I’m using up tape like crazy, I’m sure."
682," Last night I dreamt that I was at Ace Field, supposed to do a DJ thing, but I was kind of lost and wasn’t sure where I was. And I dreamt that I was on the opposite of the field from where I usually am. I’m usually at Gate , but this time I was on the side that has the sound booth, that was like about Gate , and it was kind of scary, not in the “whoo” fear sense, but in the sense that orientatively scared, and that I was like at this concession stand and I had to go up, but for a minute I was perched at the very tippy top, the absolutely toppest seat that you can have in the actual ball field area. I think it was the  or  floor, and there was a railing and I was looking down. And it’s not very often that I’m afraid of heights because I look down, but that time I looked down and I was like, “How the heck did I get up here?” And I was thinking how somehow the gates were going to open in five minutes, and the equipment was supposed to be set up around Gate , and I had to get there in five minutes, and I was at this tippy top seat. And I didn’t have any CD’s with me, and I was trying to think of some excuse how to get them to lend me some of theirs. Like, for example, that I didn’t know I was supposed to be here today or something dumb like that. And before I could even do any of this, I woke up."
683," I’m not sure how much tape I have left, so I guess I’ll have to be prepared to stop when I hear the thing coming to the end, and then start my sentence over again when it auto-reverses. Anyway, I had a kind of a blah dream last night. I dreamt that, for whatever reason, Dad had this mission to do somewhere up in the middle of the state. I think it was a medical thing. And he was going to leave – I think it was Thursday – and he was going to leave in the middle of the night and he was going to be gone Friday, Saturday and Sunday and he was going to be coming home sometime on Monday night. And while he was gone Mom and I and everybody – it was kind of understood that Mom and I were going to go up to my tech school by ourselves and have a tour there. And get this – Sheryl, Sandra and Sam were going to meet us there. And we were all going to come home and have a big house party at home. And I think they were going to hang around for the week, but I can’t remember. They might have been going to be gone by the time we got home, I can’t remember. But it was some party that we were really looking forward to. And so I think it was that he left in the middle of the night, and then it was the next day, and early Friday morning he was home. And for some reason, I can’t remember why, the trip for us to my tech school was off, and we communicated to Sheryl, Sandra and Sam that they should come meet us down in my home town instead. And they weren’t supposed to get here until Saturday afternoon. Well, you know, Dad has to be thinking about every single thing. He was starting to do a lot of that around the house, and I was thinking, “Why the heck are you home so soon anyway?” And I couldn’t wait for Sheryl, Sandra and Sam to get here, but I woke up before they did. And also in this dream, again before any of this happened, I dreamt that we were watching this spoof on the Mermaid movie, and there was this part to it that I never saw before. It was like telling some of the historical aspects of some of the characters that I never knew, like I guess some of Eric’s friends. And Eric’s friends were Arabic, and I dreamt that Eric was Arabic like Aladdin is. I guess the media is taking over. And I guess the movie showed the history of it. Wait, I think it’s going to flip. No, it’s not, I’ve got a ways yet. Anyway, it showed the history of Eric’s background, which I’d never seen before, and I think there was one brief scene in the movie where King Triton was eating French soup or spaghetti or something. That was odd! Now I know there was something else to this, but I can’t remember what it was. Oh, I know, during all the nit-picking and stuff, I was on the phone with Jane, and she had a lower voice, and she had matured a little more, and she talked about things that were more diversified and she was a little more pleasant to talk to. And I guess that’s that. I guess it came from the fact that Mom and Dad are going to take this defensive driving course to kind of lower their insurance rates, and it’s four hours each day on two days, and it was on a Monday and a Tuesday, are the two days that they’re going. And, you know, I get a ____ for them Tuesday and Thursday, so, of course, I wish they’d go on a Monday and Wednesday, but it’s not given on Wednesdays. Oh well."
684,"Last night I dreamed that everyone was in the auditorium and we all had to get up if we had ever done drama before. I was the only one not to get up. Then we all had to tell our most embarrassing moments. It was finally my turn and I began to say that I often tripped a lot in the always, when I realized no one was listening. My mother stood up and told everyone to be quiet and listen to my most embarrassing moment --how ironic, as that would easily be my most embarrassing moment. I was horrified and stormed out of the auditorium. I want to check my mailbox and the new Facebook was there. I went upstairs and there was a database there that recorded all the hookups in the entire school. Then I woke up."
685," Last night I had a bizarre dream. I was going to just go ahead and type it out because it’s really too complicated to be describing on this tape. But maybe not; maybe I’ll do alright. I dreamt that I was having this vision that when Dad was a little boy he was afraid of the same sounds that I am, and that they affected him the same way. And I was having a vision that if a nice person were there to help him through it, it would have been a lot better for him. And the chords of C, E and G, the interval that would get me, is from G to E descending, or any chord for that matter from the top to the middle, top to the middle, top to the middle like, “Ding , ding , ding , ding .” And I guess in this dream I had a vision of somebody doing that on a keyboard and Jimmy’s three years old crying, and that was weird. And then I kind of jumped over to another vision, that Mom had these candles. And they were candles, okay? Candles do not make sounds. There were these candles and they had different sounds, but there were three of them and they were called C-E-G candles because when you would light them, they would produce the chord of C, E and G over the sound system, along with a bunch of other crazy sounds. And this is bizarre. And Mom wanted to try them out with the sound system like at top volume. And it wasn’t going to be a scary thing; it was just going to be a thing. And when she lit the candles, it was like – you know how  and ’s jazz was like,  – well, it was kind of like that, it was like the funny jazz that we can’t stand. And I guess that was the extent of it and then I woke up. I think the candles came in because Mom got some candles from Clark and Marylou. And they were just smelly candles; I can’t imagine where I would get the thought that they would make sounds. Anyway, that’s that."
686,I just had a dream about Kevin...
687," Last night I had, I guess, the most bizarre dream on record – maybe not, we’ll see. But anyway, the reason why I tape these is because I just think they’re so fascinating, and it’s so fascinating how we come up with these things that we don’t even know we’re thinking about consciously. And, I don’t know, it’s almost hallucinating almost. Sometimes I’ve wondered what it’s like to hallucinate when people get high and all, do they see things and hear things like dreams that have previously sat and grown in the subconscious and matured there and turned into something whacko or something. Or do they just see random things that don’t have any connection with them at all? Anyway, that’s another thought to ponder for another day. Last night I dreamt that we were – Sheryl, Sandra and Sam were in town again, and we were watching a video for my  birthday party, which I sort of remember attending simultaneously. It was like we started watching the video and suddenly I was there, that kind of thing. I remember it was just like my graduation party except it was like a year after, only this is not really what my  birthday was like; this is how I dreamt it was like. We were at the Orange Blossom and I focused in on this crystal chandelier that was like, “Whoo hoo, _________,” because I had seen some crystal chandeliers in the ____ing catalog at the ramp  place. And somebody was sneaking in to do something, it was Sandra I think. Well, then I was like there at the party, and, you know, dancing and partying and stuff. And of all things, Sandra had Digital Performer on her laptop and she was like – what should I say? – recording and mixing the sound right there, kind of like what Dr. Moran was doing with Cake Walk in class – no wonder! I can’t remember anything about what she was doing, but then the next thing I knew, we were in my studio and she wanted to transfer the tracks to my desktop so that I could work with them, and I did a lot of hokus pokus last ____ and stuff and she said that my task ____ board can do a lot more than what I usually use it for. And what it is, in reality, is that it takes a_____ audio, turns it into digital, sends it down a USB and __________ because digital audio from a USB converts it to, it’s like an external sound card almost. That’s why I don’t need an internal one. And it also had faders and a couple other controls on it that you can move tactilely and it’ll send mini messages to the real faders to move. And Da_____ ______ thought that that feature would be great for me because I’m more tactile than visual, but I found that it was a lot easier just to go to the mixer page and look at one channel at a time and move the faders there because the task scan doesn’t have the automatically _______ faders which is clicked in the position when you open up the program like some do. It doesn’t move automatically as you move the faders on the screen; it has to synchronize them. And that is a real pain, trust me. And but so Sandra was doing all these things ________, but like ______ teachers that don’t help teach me and __________ haven’t discovered it. She was doing it right from there, in my dream, of course. And I said, “Wow, I should be able to do that too.” And let’s see, then here comes the most bizarre part. I was in this supermarket with Sheryl, Sandra and Sam, and we were like tasting candy. There was this one mix of candy called Amazing Grace that had like white chocolate balls and different stuff, but I had this plastic sign banana thing with a picture of a wave form on it, and it was represented as of the audio from the Wave Form editor. And I was down in this big center area, court like type thing in the supermarket with all kinds of people walking around. I was sitting there moving my finger along this sign banner, trying to highlight and edit the wave form. Now talk about bizarre. And I think shortly thereafter I woke up. You know, sometimes when I sit there doing all that editing, I say to myself, “I’m going to be seeing wave forms in my dreams.”"
688,I dreamed that Hannah and I were walking back to Bundy right before check-in on Saturday night. When we got inside there were at least  couples hooking up right there in the doorway. Hannah and I couldn't go to the staircase to get to our room. Then I woke up.
689,"I dreamed that I flew to University of Texas and Avery and I hung out all day. It was such a nice dream! Then we had to go to Sue's birthday dinner, and Gabby's mom was cooking for it. We had asparagus pasta, which was really good. Then I woke up."
690," Last night I had kind of a dream, it was kind of fleeting. I don’t remember too, too much, but I do remember the main components. I was at my college, going to my classes, going about my business. But in my dream my classes were kind of boring, and I had the notion that Mom was telling me that Mrs. Dougherty was in the hospital for some reason. And I can’t remember, but she told me that she had really changed. And I had a vision of kind of in this dream, I kind of had a vision of the scene that Mom was telling me about. It was like a vision within a dream, of Mrs. Dougherty standing out in the hallway in front of the little theater at my high school kind of crying and feeling really dejected, and saying through her tears how she was just totally so disappointed with all her students and totally jaded by all of them. And she decided that teaching high school music just wasn’t for her, and she was going to have to find some other profession, but it was in a really boring field she didn’t really like. And I don’t know why, whether it was for a nervous breakdown or for something unrelated or what, but she was in the hospital. And I dream that Mom was going to pick me up from my college at lunch time and take me there. And I had this thank you card that I wanted to give her from graduation, which I really do; it’s sitting on my desk. But in my dream I was going to give it to her when Mom brought me over there. And I started out at my college in the morning, and instead of being in my class, my first class was in this bedroom and the guy was like  and he was a black guy and he was an instructor. I had a feeling it was Lorenzo from the electronics class. And it was me and him and four other boys that were going to be in his class that was taught in his bedroom. And he and the guys left, and I just kind of sat there bored for like half an hour, drawing and writing, and he came back and I said, “Okay, I’m ready.” And he just said this silly little poem to us and then it was time for us to go to lunch. And I stood out where I usually wait for the cab, but in my dream I was waiting for Mom. And then I woke up. I think this came from the fact that Mrs. Dougherty called Mom and wants her to help hem dresses, and I want to give her that thank you card, and I’m kind of worried about how she’s doing this year. I know her kids seemed better last year, and I hope they’re better this year. Anyway, that’s that."
691," I had a dream that consisted of a lot of different components and scenes last night, so I’ll try to remember what I can. There’s no guarantee it’ll be in any kind of order, but oh well. First of all I dreamt that we rented the Coliseum. I’m not sure if we rented the Coliseum or if we were just going to a dance that was held there. But we had the Coliseum, we were there, and it was going to be this Christineentine’s Dance with this band, Tommy and the Fiends , I think, or something similar. And some of the fireman people and different friends of ours were going to be there. And I dreamt that, for whatever reason, we were riding our bikes over, so we wore our sloppy clothes over and we were going to change into our dresses when we got there. And I was going to wear my nice red dress and some nice jewelry, and my mom was going to wear her Franny dress. And you know what? I had the notion that this was a Valentine’s and a Halloween Dance – is that bizarre or what? Well, so anyway, we got over there and Mom forgot the dresses, so she had to go all the way back home and I was sitting in the Coliseum lobby and Dad should meet me there. And I think I was there before him. And I had the notion that all of our friends were there too, but I didn’t know who they were. And somebody up at the desk suggested that they all watch Brave Heart while they were waiting, and it was like a pay per view movie, and anybody who wanted to watch the movie had to pay. But they said, “If you want to watch the movie, show me by looking at the TV. If you don’t want to watch the movie, look over at that thing on the wall over there.” And, of course, I was just looking down the whole time, so I think it was obvious that I didn’t want to watch the movie, but I wasn’t sure. And so then all of a sudden I think I was in school and I was waiting for them to bring the costumes in school. And I was in Dr. Moran’s lab and I had the notion that I had written a report in there and I had to print something, like Mom brought the first three pages of my report but she forgot the fourth one, so I had to go in and I had to print my fourth one. And that was successful. And also, then after I printed my fourth report page, I went to Cake Walk, even though it looked totally different than what I’m used to it looking like in real life, and I dreamt that I had, I was mixing like a scene from the Little Mermaid, and I had too many tracks and an audio track, and I don’t remember what was in them except it was the Ursula scene. And I had to mix down the two MIDI tracks into audio track, then I had to mix the two audio tracks down into one, so I had to do a lot of complicated maneuvers in order to do this, and in my dream I had a nice big cursor that I could follow fast, and I didn’t have this “when you flow” factor like I do in school. And then as I was doing all this, a girl came on next to me and said something like, “Hey, what are you doing?” And she kind of distracted me, and I think – I can’t remember – but then the scene like suddenly changed and I was back at the Coliseum, but I was outside like on a beach, and I dreamt that now Dad wanted us to wait for him on this beach, and he was coming with Mom with the dresses after a while. And they were having a little party on this beach, and I was sitting under a little umbrella so that I wouldn’t get burned by the sun, and I was sitting on this like lawn chair that was like a couch almost. So I put my feet up and was laying back, and there were other people milling around getting like food and c_____s and stuff, and I had this small radio, about the size of my tape machine, maybe a little bigger, and it had an antenna that was kind of standing up, and it was on, but it was kind of quiet, and I was concerned about when people go by, was it going to be really odd or what? You know, like ________. And I was laying there, like, “Dee dee, la dee dah,” taking it all in, and then I woke up. I never did get to the Coliseum dance."
692,"I had a dream that I was walking down the main staircase in Bundy and we were all going somewhere. We got down to the first floor and someone lit a cigarette and passed it to me. I was about to take it when I saw my proctor and she told me not to touch it, so I quickly stomped it out."
693,"I dreamed that my whole floor was in the common room and we were watching Monsters Inc. There was a mummy drinking a soda, for some reason. Then I fell into a shark pit with Ed, but then I woke up."
694," I had like a really stupid dream a few days ago, and I thought it was too silly and too weird to put on this tape. I just wanted to forget about it. But today, I’m doing my research paper on dreams, and today I was reading a book and it was talking about all this stuff involved with dreams and what happens when you dream and stuff. And the only thing that was coming to me from my frame of reference was this stupid dream, so I figured there’s got to be something to it, so I guess I’m going to go ahead and put it down here. I dreamt that we were in our living room. It was Mom, Dad and I think Christine and Bill were in town, and we were sitting around talking about different things. And I was sitting on the floor and everybody else was sitting on like the couch. And then it was Mom and me and some guy – I don’t know who – and Mom had these candy-coated almond nut things that were kind of real rough and like big, and this is the bizarre part. Mom wanted me to, I think she was going to do some and she wanted me to do some. She wanted us to smooth them out and make them smaller, and the way to do it was to put them on the bed in front of us and to like lay on the bed and like self-satisfy ourselves. And I saw Mom do that with the ________s and they went from these big pecans or almonds to these small, really sweet candies. And, you know, I don’t remember too much more. There had to be more though."
695," Last night I had kind of an interesting dream. It wasn’t all that odd, but I wish I would quit having dreams about programs I used to mix sound. I mean, it’s getting a little crazy now. I’m not really sure which of these scenes came first, but I think this is the first one. I was – how come I can’t talk this morning? Okay, I think I’m ready. I was at this – no, wait – first I was at the house and my Mac machine was on the front porch. In place of the white bench there was a little table where I was sitting and working. And I was working on some part of DP all visually because the rest of my system was all upstairs, but for some reason that was there, I guess because in my dream Dad figured we could both work side by side, because he would be in the foyer and I would be out there. But the rest of my system wasn’t there with it, and I was thinking, “How in the world am I going to be able to get this back to my studio where my audio system is. Even my task scan was still up here. And just about that point I was deleting a few sound bites, and I was working on something in DP, and Mary Jo and Ken’s mother and their family were inside. I don’t know how they got there; they didn’t walk past me from the front door. And I think Elizabeth was there too. And it was like a post-graduation. We didn’t get to come to the party, so let’s have the party at your house kind of party, even though in real life they did come to graduation. And so I got up from my work for a minute and head into the kitchen to go say hi and then come back and shut down. But before I knew it, I was dancing with them, I was partying with them, I was opening presents with them. And it was dark by the time the party was like in full swing, and I realized I didn’t get to shut down. And Dad said, “Don’t worry, I shut down for you already.” And that was that. And then out of the group of people that was there, there was this one black girl, and her name was Arkisha, and Dad was talking on the phone to a Geico agent named Arkisha before. But this girl Arkisha was about my age and she wanted to go to my college with me, and she said that she had these friends that were in this Spanish band that were doing some kind of recording test in Dr. Moran’s lab, and it was like they’re weren’t testing out the equipment. The test was on them to see how well they knew how to use the equipment. And Arkisha thought that I knew a lot and wanted me and this other boy to come and help them because they needed assistance. And so in my dream my college was like just a walk away, like up on  Street, and it was more trouble to wait for the cab than to just walk over there. So we walked over there and I was barefoot, and I had like real sloppy clothes on, and we were walking around the school. And in my dream it was neat to feel the surfaces of the floor and stuff with my bare feet. And we went into Dr. Moran’s lab, and it was bigger and it had a blue floor. And there was this little area off to the side where people let bands go when they have to record, which there really isn’t. It was like an enclosed glass area with a stage and a sound board. And we were in there and Dr. Moran said that I couldn’t help those boys because I knew too much and that I wasn’t going to be just a hand, I was going to be wanting to tell them lots of information for their test. And so I was going to go home, and so I was walking out and walking home and again, it was more trouble to wait for the cab than to just walk home because I only had to go like two blocks. And then before I got home, I kind of started waking up, and then I realized where it really was and that it really was too far to walk. And then I kind of faded into consciousness."
696," At this point all I can remember of my dream last night is that we were all sitting around in the living room naked, like we do talking . And there were these people outside kind of milling around. A little later on when we put our clothes on, they ding-donged the doorbell. They kind of said that they were looking at us and that, I don’t know, one guy was kind of real sarcastic and said, “I made __________ over there.” And then they got a little more serious and said like, “Well, you guys just ought to keep your pants on,” or something like that. When we were out in the back yard and Dad wanted me to carry pepper spray when I go places, and I said, “There’s got to be a better way to defend myself.” And, I don’t know, he said something crazy like, “You’ll scream and you’ll get maimed and killed.” And I think that I woke up."
697,"I dreamed that Kevin was swimming at the beach, and he was so hot! He got out of the water and came over and kissed me. The kiss was so intense; I swear my lips were tingling when I woke up."
698," I had kind of an interesting dream last night because it was like very vivid. I dreamt that we were going camping with Gary and Polly on a Sunday up to, I think it was something like Goldhead State Park, or something like that. And Astrid, when the dream took place, it was like a Wednesday, it was like a few days before camping, Astrid was over and, well, I think even before Astrid got there, Dad was being a little crabby like he gets some times, and Astrid shows up and then Gary and Polly show up. And I’m thinking, “Oh good, we might be able to go a little early,” and, of course, a lot of people to be with, so things will be under control. And I think Gary and Polly came into my bedroom and I was like half naked, and I got a top and I put on a top, and I had to go pee and do a bunch of other things. And little did I know, but Astrid was sitting around bored most of that time. And I came into the living room and she was telling Gary and Polly, “Twice now this has happened. She asked me over and got totally distracted,” something like that. And I came and sat down next to her. She was still talking as I was walking up because she didn’t now I was coming. And then I sat down and I took her hand and I talked to her to let her know I was there. And she moved her hand against my shoulder, which she’s never done before in real life, and I was like, “I’m sorry, I just had a lot of cleaning to do and stuff.” And then when she was, a little while later, she leaned up and kind of kissed me on the cheek. And then, here comes the really bizarre part. I dreamt that this camping trip – well, not just for this camping trip – it had been done before, to have my whole system and everything piled into the back of the car, have the back seat taken out replaced with my desk and all my equipment. And I think I was counting on this setup for this trip because it was going to be quite a drive and I had some work to do for, I think for Dr. Moran, but I’m not sure who. And I can’t remember what in the world I was working on, but it was some kind of sequence. I kind of was thinking at that point that I would have access to the thing at school before I left , and I could do some of it there. And then suddenly in the course of all this, the scene shifted and I was at Dr. Moran’s lab, except it was a huge room, and there were  or  work stations, kind of like in the commons on the second floor of the Business Tech Building that people were telling me about. Well, this place was like that except the work stations were like I’m used to working at. And somebody, like two or three work stations down from me, wanted to put a picture of Santa Claus on their desktop, and actually it was a picture of her uncle dressed as Santa Claus. And I heard somebody warning the person, like the Santa Claus picture that she had might have a virus in it, but nobody seemed to really concede. And then next thing I knew, everybody had Santa Clauses on their desktops because, I guess in that situation, it would be like a network and I guess what would happen to one would happen to all of them. But I had a Santa Claus on my desktop, but I wanted to get rid of it because I wanted the picture that I had before which I can’t remember what it was. I didn’t have a picture in real life, but in my dream I was used to having a picture of me in my home studio, I think. And so I wanted that picture back. And in the a process of trying to get rid of this Santa Claus and get my picture back, something happened, and I can’t remember if it was serious or not. But it was kind of in a fog and I faded into yet another scene, that I was at home and I was listening to like the American Idol on ., and it had somebody doing their version of Celine’s “On the Line” and it sounded darned close, but it wasn’t. And then they were doing like other people’s versions of other songs. I can’t remember exactly what they were. And then I woke up."
699," Man, I seem to be having really neat dreams every day these days. I don’t know what’s up, but I dreamt that I was with this performing group. I don’t know if it was a chorus of singers or a dance group, or just a group of friends, but it was some kind of group. And I had a notion that we were either going to perform or have some kind of fun that looked like performing. But we were at this big hall, like the Front Center, and there was an ice rink, and I wanted to get on the ice rink so that I could dance and ice skate with the others. But there were these, all these things around the perimeter, like cover things or grate things that I was afraid of and I was afraid of stepping on. And I was bare foot and I was trying to navigate between them, and more of them kept popping up, and so I had to just back out and not go near the ice rink. And I know there were more scenes, but this is what I get for waiting this late in the day. I don’t remember any more."
700," Well, I guess you could say I had three dreams last night because it spanned three different areas. After all, they say we have a minimum of three dreams a night and a maximum of nine, so I guess I remember all three last night. First of all, this is kind of, we were watching – oh, wait a minute – I think there were even some more. I remember a fourth part to this. My goodness! Seeming you remember little parts, your imagination cues and you remember the rest. Dad and Mom and me and even some other people were on this boat, and I can’t remember for sure, but we were going to dock somewhere for the night, and we were going to keep going and then we were going to come back and dock in a different place for the night. And I think what it was, is we were trying to figure out where to dock. There was this docking place that was kind of old-fashioned that was built with like a porch swing and some interesting things, and a little lodge thing. And I don’t remember why we chose that place, but kind of for the reason that we chose bed and breakfasts over just hotels. And let’s see, I really don’t remember the details, but it was something about this place where we were going to dock, kind of it was an open, it was a real live environment, like we were under water, but it wasn’t; it was on top. It was like this hotel place. And so then the next scene was, is we were in this hotel place kind of sitting around, but it kind of turned into our living room, and we were watching – or at least I was watching – Celine’s Las Vegas show on TV, and how some of the things were just so complicated. And then at the end of the show it had a feature that showed her dying of a virus that she contracted from Renee, and that was like the worst thing. And then I think the next part of the dream was that I was in Dr. Schumann’s class for Psychology and he was showing us different pictures in the book, like a baby, or a horse, or other things and asking us, “What do you think people would think when they see this symbol?” And the class was like totally out of it, but I was real involved and real excited about what he was talking about and everything. Then the next part was that I was in the bathroom of the Social Arts Building at my college that kind of put me in mind of the Birch Building at my high school. And there was this boy in there that, well, I just sort of knew that the alarm box in the bathroom wasn’t working and this boy knew that a fuse had to be replaced, and he had the correct kind of fuse with him. And the boy wanted me to be in there with him when he was doing this because he said that I knew something about electronics that he was unsure of. He had this kind of real mamby pamby lack of self-confidence. So how it ended up was that I was sitting in the bathroom stall on the toilet, not really having to go, just sitting in there. And I heard him clinking and screwing and messing around, but I didn’t see what he was doing, of course. And I was just sitting on this toilet totally terrified in fright of what was going to happen if the system sounded. And I was kind of like cowering down and something like that, and the boy assured me that when the alarm system is tested, it’s only going to sound at like a quarter of the strength that it would if it was really a real incident. So believing him, I was a little at ease, but I was still real frightened of the whole thing. And , let’s see, oh, when he finished and he put the thing all back together, he tested it and it was only a quarter of the intensity. In fact, I could barely hear it, and he was like, “How do I get this thing to come on full?” meaning the alarm system. And I was like, “I don’t know, but you could ask the maintenance people.” And he was a nice boy. He wasn’t one of these teenage sadists, so he gave me time. He said he was going to give me time to get outside and get far away from the building and all like that, and when I went out the back of the Social Arts Building, it was like the track on the PE field of my high school, and I sat down near these people that I thought I knew. I started talking to them and they said how, for degree-seeking students, how your first semester was like four general ed classes, boom, boom, boom. And that’s what they took, and they said how bored they were. And I was glad I wasn’t in their position. And I think that the last part of this dream was that I was back in Dr. Schumann’s class, and he wasn’t showing us symbols like a baby or a horse. He was showing us more serious symbols like what does it mean to speak to people, how do you think people feel when they have their eyes covered? What happens when they hear certain things? And just real in-depth things like that. And again, the class was like, “Uh, uh, uh, uhhh….” And I was raising my hand and wanting to talk about some of these things, and he was like looking around for the rest of the “Uhhhhh, uhhhhh” people and trying to enlist them into paying attention and stuff. And then I woke up. I have a voice analysis to give about the second part of this dream, the part about being in the bathroom with that boy while he was fixing the alarm box in the bathroom. I think that, first of all in this case, the bathroom does not represent a cleansing environment. It might, but most likely it represents a live environment which would be the worst place that a person would want to be when an alarm system sounds. But what it could be is it could be a cleansing place that appears to have some kind of frightening thing to overcome in order to cleanse yourself. And, of course, the alarm system is the major element of fear in this part, and represents something majorly frightening. The boy, I tend to think, represents a higher power, because the boy really is sympathetic to my being afraid of the alarm system, but he wants me to participate in the operation that he is doing, even though he knows that I’m majorly afraid of it, because he thinks that I can contribute to it in some positive way. And he assures me that it won’t be as bad as I’m making it out to be. And also he isn’t, he gave me plenty of time to escape when he did want the system to sound at full capacity. So I think there’s something going on here, something that needs to occur in my life that may seem frightening, but is worthwhile and I just to have to go through it. I don’t know. This is deep, man. "
701,I had a dream that I found the perfect Halloween costume!
702," Last night I was having a dream that I was like a dual enrollment student doing Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays at my high school, and only being excused for the time I had to go to the college. And I had a test that I had to take in Psychology at the college, but the test was given to the office of my high school for some reason and I had to go by Ms. Thompson’s office and get it. And I had to do a couple other things that I can’t remember, but I want to know why I keep dreaming about being back in Mr. Johnson’s class. It was boring, so I really don’t want to be back there, but I guess I keep thinking like I am. And I dreamt that I was in Mr. Johnson’s class and we were lifting weights and listening to his boom box, and I had to get out of class and go take my test, but I was kind of chicken and didn’t know how to ask him and he wasn’t even around. And so I had the notion that I’d better just leave and go take my test. And then I woke up."
703," Last night I had kind of a funky dream about Astrid. I dreamt that it was kind of daylight, but I was still half asleep, and there was somebody in my bed and I thought it was Mom, so I rolled over and put my arm around her like when I do when Mom would be in my bed. Well, after a while, she turned over and started talking to me, and I realized it was Astrid and she was kind of holding me too, just like Mom does. But for some reason she was calling herself Kendra. And we were talking about various things, like I don’t think she told her Greek mythology story again, but she was thinking how, she was just chatting like people do. And, let’s see, I think we got up and we were rearranging my closet, putting some clothes in order and stuff, and I was showing her my porcelain dolls and she was like changing. In life we just dress in front of each other because, first of all, she can’t really see so it’s not a big deal to her. And, of course, I can’t either! And so it just works out both ways and we just dress right in front of each other. So that’s what we did in my dream. And I had this glow worm that I was showing her and the glow worm had like a head band with a butterfly, and she was going to take the butterfly off the head band. Here’s where it gets bizarre . So anyway, she wanted to take the butterfly off the head band of the glow worm and put it on a ribbon to tie around her waist – I don’t remember how and it was kind of a little scary – but I was, for some reason she like did something really weird and I had to explain to her about a woman’s body and why her private area was important to be clean and covered and all. And she seemed to understand, she seemed to be taking it like a sisterly thing. And then I woke up. And it’s funny because oftentimes when I first wake up I can’t remember my dream at all. And I just have to think for a while. And sometimes they come to me in the middle of the day. Most people it’s just the opposite, and that’s how this one worked."
704," Last night I had kind of a long dream, but it wasn’t too, too long. I dreamt that we were going up to Be_____, my home state again, or somewhere up there, I wasn’t exactly sure where it is, and we were going to stay at this rental like party house with, instead of Janice and Larry and Gary and Polly, we were going to stay with Sheryl, Sandra and Sam and Christine and Bill and Josie and Bobby. And there were about two or three bedrooms on the bottom floor, like two bedrooms on the top floor, and one bedroom at the very tippy top of the third floor. And mine was up on the third floor. Mine was the top one because I had like a lot of sound equipment that I was bringing in for their party, and, come to think of it, it wouldn’t make sense to put me and my equipment on the third floor. It would make sense to put us on the ground floor! But in my dream I was on the third floor and this place had an elevator, so I guess I could get it down alright. And to get there I think Mom and Dad preceded me because I had one more day of classes or something. And so I was on this bus, and I had two Peavey Escort systems for some crazy reason, I had a bunch of other stuff, but I wasn’t sure exactly what. And I never actually had it in my hands. I had a few people helping me get it on the bus and into this cargo bay, and then when I got there, I don’t remember getting there; I just remember suddenly being there. And I don’t remember too much about the party we were having, but I do remember staying there, and I sort of remember something about us being together for like a little party or something, and it was outside on the deck. I had the Peavey system out there with the wireless mic. And then we kind of all went to sleep. I had the notion that the party was on the last night that we were going to be there, so after the party I didn’t take the Peavey system down and bring it back to my room or anything, I just left it set up. And we all kind of went to sleep. And I remember that night I didn’t go up to my room on the third floor with some other equipment piled into my room. That night I just went to _____ and I crashed in Sheryl, Sandra and Sam’s room with them. And the next morning – you know how Dad likes to leave out of the house like : o’clock in the morning if we’ve got to drive across the state so we can get home at like a reasonable hour? Well, that’s what we did, and, of course, I don’t have any brains at that hour and then I think we were in the car and halfway through coming home, I realized I forgot both of the Peavey systems and all my other equipment. I left it there. And it was really a bad thing because Halloween was right around the corner. And we called Uncle Bob on the cell phone and he said, “No problem, we’ll swing by that way on the next step on our trip. We’ll bring it and drop it off for you.” And we said, “Okay, that would be great.” And, let’s see, oh, when we got home, Uncle Bob had sent a new bag of Halloween things for me, like some plastic rats and some spiders and two statues – no, three or four statues of cats coming out of pumpkins and ghosts and various things and like lab  statues that were like about as tall as my figures now. And there was a statue of Sir Mix-a-Lot, and at the base of the figure it said, “Baby Got Back.” And, of course, Mom was complaining. Oh, and there was one other thing he gave me. It was like a head, a pilgrim head on a stick with a stand. And Mom was really upset because she didn’t want to store all this new Halloween stuff. And she was like totally spoiling it for me. And all this stuff was meant to be a thank you for DJ’ing their party or something like that. And then I began to fade into consciousness and I was still kind of out there, but I realized that my Peavey system is on the porch. I just handled it last night, but I was wondering if I had left the wireless mic and other stuff over there. And then when I really came to, I realized that I only have one and it’s all in my closet and that was just a dream. "
705,"I dreamed that I was in the main building and I was making out with someone. I felt kind of awkward about doing that in public, so I left to go to lunch. For some reason, it was graduation tomorrow. I was astounded. Where did the whole year go? I felt like it had just been fall, and now all of a sudden it was graduation? I saw the seniors packing their bags and loading them into their cars. I began to cry so hard because I had not spent enough time with everyone. After graduation, I was playing hockey, when I should have been studying for exams. I went back to the library and Hannah and Sue were there. Albert came back from Spain and told us he had moved to the ocean. Then I had to think about college!?! Thank god I woke up!"
706," Last night I had a dream that I was, I got like a, it was not like a mini disc machine, but it was sort of like that, and it came with five or six packs of like little mini CD R’s and it was like a mini disc, except the medium was CD’s instead of they’re like mini CD’s. And I don’t remember actually, but I remember thinking how good it was that I had five or six packages of these things. And I don’t remember too much except I think Dad wanted me to wrap it up and take it down to like the beach or something so that we could have a party out there and I could like open it for my birthday or something. And then suddenly the scene shifted, and I was in the downstairs bedroom listening to a couple CD’s, and I dreamt there was a CD changer in there, which there really isn’t, and it was like : o’clock in the morning when I was doing this. And Mom comes in and all of a sudden I was trying to turn it down because I’m a little embarrassed that I’m like just here. And she said, “It’s alright, it’s alright,” and something like that. She told me something else that she’s going to do. She’s like going to do something in the kitchen or something. So she goes in the kitchen and all of a sudden the kitchen radio in there, I had the notion that it’s a CD changer also, and all of a sudden the CD that I was listening to jumps over there to her and she has to listen to it, and it was kind of a dumb one. And I can’t remember anything more. I think I woke up after that. There was something else I remember about this dream now. For some reason, after Mom and I had talked, I was laying there on the bed thinking up a story."
707," Last night I had a dream that, well, I remember a bunch of scenes, but I can’t really tell you which ones came first. But I’ll do my best at putting them in order. This is going to be another one that uses up a lot of tape, I think. First, I think, I was having lunch with Ms. Fletcher at this little strip of shops and restaurants that I had the notion was part of the my college campus or just off of it or something. We were eating there and there were some interesting places there, and I was watching the time close because I had to get up to class. And so I went over to the Fine Arts Building, which looked more like the Media Building from my high school, and I went into class. Then next day I was there with Mom and it was like evening time, and I think I had asked her to take me to a bar or take me dancing or something, since I’m  now. And so we were going to this little restaurant place that we thought was going to be cool, and they had this table and chairs outside with their sound system set up and this band that was playing some good stuff. And we were dancing and dancing for a while, I think, and then she’s like, “I’ve got to take you somewhere else for a minute, but we’ll come back here, I promise.” And she took me into this store, or some kind of place, next door in the shopping plaza thing. And it had an ivory-colored, off-white colored floor. It was almost yellow because of the lights. It was like Circuit City or something. And she was going to like boost me up on her shoulder. She used to be able to do that, but now Dad’s only strong enough to. But anyway, in my dream she could still boost me up on her shoulder. She’s like, “One, two, three,” and I was like perched on her shoulder and she was showing me this shelf way up high that had like six keyboards laid out on it. And I was like, “Wow!” And so then she got me down and we went back dancing at that place for a while and I’m trying to think here. And I think we danced or something, or we ordered some food or something, but then the scene just sort of like changed, and I was in the Fine Arts Building, which like I said, which kind of looked like the Media Building at my high school. And I was trying to find my class, I was trying to find Dr. Moran’s lab in there, and I was walking around this hall and I came across this room that I went in. It was really dark and there were three or four girls kneeling in there rehearsing this song in harmony, and I didn’t know then that I didn’t know the song, and I had this like furry purse with me that was black and I sort of in my head called it a mink purse. And so I didn’t really know them and so I just left, and I was coming down the stairs, and the stairs were real, real narrow. There was no railing on one side, and there was a sort of a “meh” railing on the other side, and I was going down the stairs and I managed to get down alright, sort of. It was really steep and really narrow, like I dream about stairwells being sometimes. It wasn’t dark and scary like they are sometimes, it was just hard for me to navigate, especially with the purse that turned into my book bag in the other hand. And I got down and Mom – I can’t remember if it was Mom, I think it was Mom – picked me up in the truck, and we were going to the park. And when we got to one intersection there were like, I couldn’t see them but she told me they were there – there were like two fire trucks, a rescue truck, and a ladder truck, I think – four trucks all together. And I kind of felt like maybe Dad was in one of them and they were going to a call. And they were all running their lights and sirens. How it would work was they would only run their lights and sirens when they were moving, so when they stopped at a red light, they wouldn’t run them. And so it seemed that they would always be an intersection ahead of us, and when we would catch up to them and stop at their intersection, we would all go at the same time. And then when their lights and sirens would race past us and I would hear them real loud for minutes and then they’d be like past us. And then they would wait at the next intersection until we got there, and they wouldn’t go until we got there. And then they ran their lights and sirens real loud in our faces again. And they did that like three times and I was like terrified when we got to the park. But fortunately, when we got to the park, they turned down another street and were gone. And then I woke up. "
708,"I had so many dreams last night! The first dream was that during study hall, I was abused. From :-: I could work and study, but then at , I had to strip down to my underwear and go into a cell where it was wet and freezing cold. I was abused and hurt or an hour and a half and I was furious because I didn't even know why. I hated it! Then I had a dream that my family and I were all going on a trip to Sea World. My brother and I sat in the splash section, and then left hurriedly. On the way home, we were playing in the sand, trying to set up some sort of box. We got sand in our eyes and rushed to wash it out with the ocean water. Our eyes really burned then from the salt and the sand. Then Hannah and I were walking back from lunch or something to Bundy. The seniors were all trying to yank each other's pants off to embarrass one another. When Hannah and I got to the dorm, we had emails from all of them saying something bad was going to happen. Anyway, then I had a dream about Counting Crows, that I was going to see them. Then I woke up."
709,I had a dream that I was walking around in my underwear and someone complimented me on what a nice lower back I had. Odd...
710,"I dreamed that I was in the main building and I was wearing my angel costume. Lou started chasing me because he wanted to take my wings. He finally caught up with me and took them. Then I began to chase him through the hallways. He ran upstairs to the little quad of chairs outside of the history wing. I cornered him and he collapsed onto one of the couches. I began to tickle him to get my wings back. He was very ticklish and was squirming uncontrollably. Eventually, he dropped my wings. When I bent over to pick them up, he grabbed me and pushed me onto the chair. He then began to tickle me. I was breathing so hard. I begged him to stop, and he finally did. Then he leaned down to kiss me. All of a sudden it was a new dream. The science building was attached to the main building through a long, tall staircase right near the yearbook room. I remember having to go to the yearbook room to layout some more pages. Then I woke up."
711,"I dreamed that Mason was lying in a stone coffin next to some really tall, scary statues. I had to save him, so I ran next door and the ceiling caved in. Then I woke up."
712," Last night I was dreaming that I had to go to school at my college and I had to ride a bus, and for some reason my classes didn’t start until : o’clock so the bus could wait until : to come and it would be okay. Well, let’s see, oh, first of all, I dreamt that, well, first of all in real life, there’s a substitute teacher that comes in to electronics class when Mr. Martin is out, his name is James Hill. In my dream James Hill didn’t think I was doing up-to-par work, and I was going to write this paper to prove what I knew and I was going to hurry up and write it long-hand before the bus came in the morning. And I can’t remember what we were talking about, but Dad and were laying on the bed talking and talking and talking and before I knew it, all my time was gone and I didn’t get to write the paper. And then – this is the crazy part – there was this candy bar, actually on all the Phi Beta Kappa candy bars I had the notion that they would look interesting if we drew some kind of picture with like frosting. And I seem to recall the wrapper having that kind of picture, and before I knew it some kid ran up on the porch and offered me three treats out of his Halloween pumpkin if he could give me back one of the candy bars he bought from me, and that was cool. And I used that one, and I could have sworn the wrapper was going to have some picture on it for us to draw from, but it didn’t. And I was saying how, if I had the time, I would be creative and I would draw little things in each square, but I didn’t have that kind of time. And I can’t remember why I put it . We were eating pizza for breakfast, the leftovers of Brittany’s pizza, and I think I remember something else, just before I woke up and Dad was walking out the door, he said something like, “But I’m not sure, but you guys just hate it!” And then I woke up."
713," Last night I had a dream, but I don’t know if it’s all that important. It was kind of funny, though, but kind of boring in a sense. I dreamt that we were supposed to meet Grandma and Grandpa at this little restaurant, kind of like the days when we used to meet them at Ruby’s all the time. Then it got to where we would drive over to Ruby’s, then it got to the point they didn’t really want to go out that much any more. But it used to be we would meet them at Ruby’s. Well, I dreamt that we were doing something like that, except it was like this little restaurant like Chucky Cheese, and there was this set of tables that had reserved that the waitress brought us to that had – what should I say – this little circle of, it was like a choo choo train merry-go-around thing and had these seats that people sat in that represented little animals, like there was a – they didn’t really look like the animals to the sight that I had, but I sort of had the notion and the waitress told me that they were animals. One was supposed to be a sheep, one was supposed to be a lion, and I can’t remember what the others were. And they called it the Ziggety Zoo suite or something stupid like that. And, let’s see, I think I started riding in the sheep one, even though it was just sort of like a rocking chair with twirly whirls on the back, and it would go round and round and round and tipsing and over and upside down, and it dumped me out and I fell on the floor. And I think about that time Grandma and Grandpa came into the restaurant and my eyes were like closed. I could see darkness, I was coming into stage  sleep, but I sort of felt like they had the notion that I had fallen and I couldn’t get up. And I was laughing hysterically still in my dream. And Mom was like, “She’s asleep, she’s asleep,” on the floor there, and then I just kind of woke up."
714," Last I night I had several dreams, but the first one that I was in bed in this strange place, and Mom came up and I was kind of half asleep and half awake, and started picking the scab off my foot with tweezers and it hurt so much and I screamed. And then she was gone. So then I was out to find her. So we were staying in these like three or four level house unit things, like we were exploring across the street from the park on  Street and I saw that it was becoming daylight by the time I got out there. And Carl and Arlene had one and they were sitting out on their front porch. But I couldn’t find the one for Mom and Dad and there were a lot of them that didn’t look like anything. So then I was just trying to run back and find mine and I couldn’t. I couldn’t find – there were like ten of these things in a row and I couldn’t find mine. And then I sort of woke up. "
715," Then I dreamt that we were with Allison and she was doing this little home video presentation like type thing and we were going to help her. I don’t know if it was Allison or Terri, but I think it started out as Allison, and we were in her house and we were doing some talking and singing and stuff by video. Then I realized Allison turned into Terri and she was taking pictures of us naked, just as normal as anything, in this like bare garage area. And I had to go home and get another set piece, and I ran back and I set up, and they didn’t need it after all. They were just going to take pictures of us on the couch. And that’s all, I think."
716," Last night I dreamt that Dad had some kind of city meeting to go to, and Mom wanted to go to an art show, and I guess I was going to go with her. And there was something about, “Okay, this is the rule: we’re going to each do our own thing and we’re not going to run into each other.” And so we set off on our bikes, and there was like this booth set up that we were supposed to go see, but we never really…. Oh, I know, she was going to go see her art, and afterwards we were going to do something together. And I was kind of being babysat at a fire station while she was going to look at her art. And they were doing something inside like a show thing and I got to go in and see it. And I was worried about them doing their sirens and this and that, but they said they weren’t going to do that for some reason. While I was outside talking to a lady in the back, I heard three sirens, one each had two tones at different intervals, and I told her the intervals that I didn’t mind. It was one broader than the usual. I don’t know, but it was broader than the one that gives me nerves. So then we went inside and we got to see this show. It was kind of dark and we were all like sitting on the floor. This was this girl, she was playing taps on like a huge bugle thing, and then she had a keyboard that she was playing some jazz on, and apparently she got her right and left hands mixed up because her mom kept saying, “Wrong arm, wrong arm,” or something like that. And then there was this Indian dance that was like shaking shaker things or something. Then suddenly I was with Mom again, and we were going off to, we were going to find someplace to dance and have fun because it was a Friday night, and I don’t know if we ever found a place or not. I seem to remember looking at a menu at this bar place, but it’s all I can remember."
717," Last night I had a dream that Sheryl, Sandra, and Lee and Sam and Mickey were in town. I don’t know if Lee was there, but I know the others were there. And I had the notion that Sandra was getting married again. I wasn’t sure if it was remarrying to Lee, or if it was marrying somebody else, but her and Sheryl and everybody were like keeping everything all secret for some reason, I guess they just didn’t know, and they were all kind of unprepared. She was just getting herself together. And I didn’t really know if I was supposed to be her DJ sound person for her reception or not, and I was going to go over to her and ask her and say, “Hey, what about your reception?” because I had to know whether I should pack up the Peavey system or not. And I don’t remember what she told me; I think she said, “I’m still not sure.” So that’s pretty unsure. And so I packed everything up, just in case, and I think we were in the truck going down there, and Sam was driving, and I was there and there was somebody else, I think it was Mickey in a black dress, and all the other people on a different vehicle. And then I kind of woke up. I didn’t think this was important enough to put on here, but then I realized that maybe it is because it kept coming back to me all day today. And I think it came from listening to the graduation footage and all the commotion that was going on in our house that we’d been hearing all their voices again, and thinking about when they were in town and all like that. And I guess that’s all I have to say."
718,"I dreamed that I was at school. Hannah and I were all in the library studying for exams. Neo, from The Matrix, was there getting us to try different kinds of jellybeans. All of a sudden, we were back in the dorm. Sue was showering and Hannah and I were in our room eating Cape Cod chips. When Sue came in, the fire alarm went off. We all had to get out of the building. The sprinklers went off. So then I had a new dream that I was at Audrey's house and Pauline was getting married. Audrey wanted me to ride Pauline's horse into the woods to find the rest of our relatives. When I got on the horse, he started talking to me. Then I woke up."
719,"I dreamed that they were redoing the post office part of the main building to look more like the Sistine Chapel. Mr. Links was trying out different practice schedules. I studied for exams. Anna and I were trying to figure out when we had practice. I kept falling over and falling asleep throughout the main building and around the athletic center because I was so tired. I told Charla she needed to get Jay to ask him something about our class. So he came over and tried to wake me up. I felt so weak. I only woke up when Lou came to get me. We then walked to the Sistine Chapel to find out when we had practice, but there were so many staircases that I couldn't find where to go. Then I was in front of the dorms. Then I woke up."
720," Last night I had kind of a stupid dream . I dreamt that I was at our house, but somehow I was in the dining room and our machine was set up in there for some crazy reason. And I was working on XP, a much more opulent desk than what we have, and I think I was, I was either typing something in Word or I was looking at pictures; I can’t remember which. But Dad was waiting for me to finish something so we could go for a walk or something, and, you know, in real life it’s set up so Dad and I have separate logins so that our display settings can be set. Well, I dreamt that in my dream I was so in a hurry, I shut down and I forgot to logoff. And instead of shutting down, it was doing a restart and acting all crazy. And Dad was leaving out the door without me because I had to stay and attend to it. And I think I woke up. That was really stupid. I’m kind of wired for sound tonight, can you tell?"
721,"I dreamed that I was playing soccer down on the fields. There was going to be a pep rally later, so I hurried to the athletic center to shower and change. In the locker room I bumped into Lou. He was wearing red boxers and he had a white towel in front of him. He was laughing, so then I began laughing and woke up."
722," Last night I had kind of a long dream. Let’s see how much of it I can actually remember. First I dreamt that me and Sheryl and Sandra and Sam and a couple other people were staying in this house, like a bed and breakfast, except the owner wasn’t there. It was just the place was all to ourselves. And we were doing a bunch of things, I can’t remember what, and it was our last night there and somebody warned me that they were going to have to do a fire drill just because it was in the protocol that they had to do it, but that none of us had to be there when they did it because they just had to test the alarm system. So I was getting dressed and I was getting my clothes on really fast, hoping that I could get out there before they actually did it. So I was getting dressed and I grabbed my bags and I slipped my shoes on and I went outside. And I put my bags by the truck, and I started walking down the alley a little ways so that I could be further away from the building, I guess. And I was just standing, when I thought I was far enough away. Well, Sheryl, she comes out and she has this red thing in her hand. I guess I thought it was one of the sound emitters from the building , and she had it in her hand, and I start running, and she says, “Oh, smart girl!” And she catches up to me and she stuffs this thing in my back pocket, and I rip it out and I throw it and I keep running. And she grabs it and she runs after me, and she comes near me with it again, and I ran some more until I was far enough away and then I stopped. And then I dreamt that I was in class. I didn’t know if it was Business Law class or one of my new classes for next semester, but I was in class and they were doing busy book work in class, which is very rare, and I was doing mine and I was looking at something that I wrote. I mean, I was looking, I had this paper and it was, it had a big design on the top of an Indian holding a bow and arrow, and I was looking at something that I had printed on it from my machine upstairs here, like I had a printer. And I printed right over the top of this bow and arrow picture, and it was a big, like half a page, picture. And it was something very personal. It was a journal entry about the thing in the last scene about staying in the picture, running away from Sheryl. And then I was like in the kitchen with Mom, and I was standing up on this – oh, wait – after the bow and arrow paper thing, some girl kind of got a little faint and leaned on my desk, and the teacher came to the other side of my desk and was trying to support her. And I got like smashed in between them so that I could hardly breathe. I was feeling very faint, and I couldn’t duck my head and get out from under them or between them or anything. And I can’t remember any more."
723,I had a dream that I was taking a vocab quiz in a language I had never seen before!
724,"I had a dream that we were doing the proctor switch. Hannah and I lived on Bundy  and our proctors were taking us down to the lake to take a walk. There was a huge octopus that lived on Bundy . His tentacles were blocking all the doors. On the way up from the walk, the proctors were throwing worms. It was horrible. When we got up to school, Sue was baking Krispy Kremes. Then I woke up."
725," Last night I had an interesting dream. It was pretty long, but I think it speaks a lot. I dreamt that Mom and I were going to go on this Halloween party boat and we had tickets and she had bought them for $. somewhere. And we were going to kind of slip out because the party went from like : until like : or : in the morning, so we were going to slip out after he went to bed, and we were going to go. And she was sleeping in my bed here, which really she wasn’t, but in my dream she was. And we were talking about, actually I think we were laying on the floor and we were talking about how we were going to go, we were going to go and keep sneaking up behind us. And then I go downstairs and he sees how, I think he heard a lot of what we were conspiring to do. And he picks me up and he holds me and he feels really sorry that – what should I say? – I guess that he’d made the image that he had, and something else like that. And I just come out and tell him that Mom and I had these tickets to this party. And the party was supposed to be on a boat, and they were like for, they for cheap, and that we were going to go. So we go, and, of course, I was expecting like a big boat and a band and a show and a party and stuff. But this was like, you know at an airport there’s a long hall that connects to the plane? Well, in this situation there was a building that was an art gallery, and there was a long hallway corridor that was leading to this square room, and there was a gray rug, and it was supposed to be the boat. This square room with a gray rug was supposed to be a boat, this big party boat that everybody was talking about. So I knew – and even though it was supposed to happen at night, it was light outside, and the only seats were the ones that we were in. And I get on first because I’m afraid that we’re going to be late, and Mom is there looking at pictures and she says she’ll be meeting me. And who comes on and joins me, but Dad instead. He like takes her place. And, let’s see, so we start sailing, and it’s like, they like do something, seal off the engines like they do on a plane, and we kind of shove off from the building with this square room, sailing through the water. Maybe this is because all I see of the plane area is a square cabin, but anyway, pretty soon, when we’re sailing, the floor goes away, the glass in seals it goes away, they put some, that orange construction fence around and a board for the roof and just a seat and that’s all. And then it stops and we’re like swinging around inside of it, there’s like water in it, and really not a party at all. But Dad had me dive to the bottom and show me where there some connection made underwater for the sound system, I think, which I don’t know why that would be, if there’s no sound and no party. But anyway, let’s see, I think we go past a beach and Mom just kind of swims out from the beach and comes and joins us. And then I kind of woke up. That was really a bummer because I was expecting to go on this party, but it wasn’t. It was just a dumb little ocean cruise thing. I think this comes from the fact that Rib Fest  was last year and she and I went to see Swarner  and we had a great time. And this year BTO was playing last night, but it was their TV night. That and Third Watch was on. And tonight is Creedence Clearwater Revival and Astrid’s coming, but if she doesn’t come for whatever reason, we can go, I think. So that’s that."
726,"I dreamed that I was Ariel from The Little Mermaid. I was swimming all over the place in the lake. People were on a ship telling secrets and I wanted to know what they were saying so badly. But I couldn't climb up onto the ships. But I couldn't climb up. Anyway, then I was in the dining hall, sitting at the senior boys' table. Ed was there. We went outside and walked around and talked about love. When we got inside, all the senior boys were doing some sort of race on the ramp. I went to go watch and Lou was up. After he went, he grabbed my hand and yanked me away from the crowd. My mother had booked a makeover for me, but I didn't really want one. Then I woke up."
727,I dreamed that I was burning a CD in the music room.
728," I was having kind of an interesting dream last night. Let’s see, how should I start? Well, first of all, I don’t know if I was back at my high school or still at my college, but I had some classes to go to, and I was oftentimes I would go like to the bathroom in between classes. Well, in this one class that I was in, I met the teacher and she said that I really needed to not be late so much because I was getting behind in material. And, oh, this is so weird – this class was a PE/ Music class. We were going to be like singing, but she said we had to get stronger by doing things like sit-ups and lifting weights and stuff. And so we would do a combination that, and I think there were like no more desks and I was like standing in the back of the room, and she was teaching us about theory, and she was showing how chromatic scales are a lot easier to play, but major scales sound better and more complete. And I’m trying to think, I don’t remember the examples she gave. This room was like kind of small, but there were like, I don’t know, two or three rows with people in front of where I was standing, if that means anything. And this teacher was like a nice woman, she was wearing jeans, I think. And I don’t think Mrs. Dougherty ever wore jeans, and I don’t think Mrs. Hager did either, but she seemed like jeans was like something about her personality that she was more like Mrs. Hager, more casual and what have you. But suddenly the scene like shifted, and I was at home and I was fixing some kind of lunch for myself, and I hear this funny sound in the living room and I can’t figure out what it is. And Mom said that she had borrowed and brought home a Yamaha Clavinova, not from Dr. Moran’s lab, but from this teacher. And she said that the teacher had told her that I was kind of like, kind of bashful about touching it, and she wanted my mom to work with me with it. And let’s see, the thing of it was, when you would walk towards it, it would make this funny buzzing sound, like when you first, I don’t know, a feedback loop in the lower frequency range, I guess you could say. But it didn’t do that at home, I don’t know why, so I saw it in the living room and Mom was trying to convince me to sit down in front of it, and it started shrinking and shrinking and shrinking, and before I knew it, it was the size of something for a Barbie doll. And then I woke up. Well, wait a minute, one other crazy twist I remember about this dream: when it was shrinking and shrinking, Mom like took a piece off of it, and I realized that it was chocolate with like vanilla frosting, and that it really wouldn’t make any sound if I were to touch it and try to carry a tune. So she cut off a piece of the chocolate from the edge and I had a bowl of ice cream and she just threw this piece of chocolate in my bowl of ice cream. And I really didn’t want to finish my ice cream, but I woke up before I could."
729,"So first I dreamed that I was at my high school and it was the last day of this year. All these guys were asking me out. Then I was at college in California. It was the kind of college where if you went to my high school, you immediately went to this college. Then there were other kids from other schools there as well. It was really dangerous. We had to cross  roads all next to each other to get to the school. The last  were these horribly steep and narrow staircases where people would skateboard. I was walking down them and the skateboarders couldn't see us. So I was especially scared. I finally got to my dorm and all my friends were going skating. They all left and I changed and put sunscreen on. Andrea and Camilia were there and they wanted to know if my boyfriends at my high school had made me any more comfortable with dating in college. I guess I kind of blew them off, because next thing I know, I am at the beach. It started to rain, so I had to go back to school. I was so sad when I looked at all these pictures of my high school friends and realized how much I missed them. I was in English with a lot of the freshmen, and Ms. Williams came in and announced we were having the school play that day. Everyone was really excited, except me, because it was a Tuesday, and Tuesdays were my best days, so I would have to miss my favorite classes. We had  minutes before we had to be in the auditorium. I went looking for my friends. Sue was giving a tour. Gianna and her brother were up in the math wing. I started walking to the dining hall. Gabby was in the senior quad and she started making fun of me because I always looked shy. Beside her was a shelf of books. They were all fictional love stories. Then I woke up."
730,I had a dream Hannah was getting married!
731," I had an amazingly wonderful dream last night. At first I wasn’t going to record it, but then I realized if I’m going to be true to myself while I’m doing all this psychoanalysis, I have to record it. I can’t just portray myself favorably like human nature says we do, because then I’d be calling the kettle black, trying to figure out everybody else’s mishaps. So no matter how embarrassing it might be at times, I’m going to try to tell all that comes into my life. I dreamt that Sheryl, Sandra and Sam were in town, and they were kind of planning something for me for Christmas, and come to think of it, we were planning surprises for each other for Christmas. And we had just come back from some beach thing. I think we were coming back from a long walk on the beach that was nice, and we were all riding in this van - Sheryl and Sandra and Sam, Nikki and me. And Mom and Dad were there. I sort of like had the notion that they were there because I heard them talk, but some driver was driving us around, like one of my cab drivers. And we were talking about various things, I can’t remember what exactly. But Dad was asking me questions like, apparently in my dream he had heard my CD that I had burned from Music and Computers class, which I really haven’t burned it yet, and he was asking me questions like, “How did you do all this stuff?” and “Do you know how to play any songs?” and this and that and the other. And the van driver stopped and we all got out, and we went into this place that was kind of like the foyer area of the Rattison Hotel that we go to for awards and ceremonies sometimes, except this place was carpeted, and it was big and spacious. But I didn’t know exactly where we were, but it was someplace fancy and elegant. I kind of had the notion that it was a furniture store because there were couches and chairs and tables and stuff spaced out all over everywhere. And I think there was a staircase off to the side, and it was kind of brownish carpeting. And Dad had me – think it was Lee, I don’t know if it was Lee or Dad – but one of them had me sit down at this keyboard, like the model we have in school, and play “Joy to the World.” And I put my hand at the top of the middle C octave, but as I was descending down the scale, like you do in the first line, I realized that the thing was like up sideways and I like, I don’t know how to explain it, but it was like instead of horizontal, it was almost vertical. It was kind of like at an angle almost. And after you got down to G, the C octave just kind of disappeared and you had to take your thumb and go along the side of the unit with these “dup dup dup dup” things on the side, these little rounded keys after G. F, E, D, C were on the side; they were little rounded things. And it got more and more horizontal and more and more horizontal, and then I realized it was all white, but amazingly enough I was able to play this song perfectly. And Dad was pretty amazed, and he said, “You have to have one for Christmas.” And he said that this model that we were sitting near was kind of an old-fashioned type of model, and he was in search of one that was, I don’t know, like a few generations up, I guess you could say, you know how units are. But somehow I wasn’t really supposed to know and Sandra – we were back in the van and Sandra was like, you know how Sandra is in surprises – she’s very good at keeping them. And then – what should I say? – down, a little while later the scene just shifted, and I was in the dining room and I saw the manual for the model that I was going to have, and I was going to take it over to the video magnifier and read some of it. But I woke up first. And that was that."
732," Last night I had an okay dream; it wasn’t all that great. But I dreamt that I was at home and there was this woman who came over to talk to me, and she was an elderly woman like Mindy Stoltz, except she was calling herself Mrs. Lester, and she was talking like Mrs. Dougherty, so apparently she was a figure that was all of those rolled into one. Bizarre, man. And I was sitting on the stairs and she was kind of like laying on the stairs above me and like leaning on her elbow so she could talk to me, and she was saying how it would sure be nice if I could be coming back to my high school and attending a chorus rehearsal so that I could be in the concert. And I was explaining to her that I wish I could, but I have college. And you know how people sometimes lay a guilt trip on you and stuff. Well, she was like trying to do that. Anyhow, she had this sweet old lady kind of a voice, and Mrs. Dougherty doesn’t lay a guilt trip on people if they’re not actually in the group full time, but this woman did. So she was talking to me about coming to rehearsals and all, and I can’t remember, but I think she gave me a teddy bear and some kind of diamondy-like Christmas ornament. And I’m trying to think what else. I let it slip away because I went back to sleep this morning instead of record it. A thing with me is sometimes I wake up with a really dry throat and feel like “bleah….”, I’m in a groggy sleep state, and if I get out my tape machine and record my dreams, I’ll sound like really far away like I do sometimes, and I’ll be all dry, and you know how that goes. So I think I wait until I’m a little more awake and I’ll sound a little more normal, but then I forget half the dumb thing. And sometimes I’m too lazy to reach over and grab this thing, so I guess I’ll just have to do that."
733," Last night I had kind of an interesting dream. I dreamt that I was coming home from school and my driver said that he wasn’t going to have any calls for a while, and it was the middle of the day and he wanted to take me to this theme park and I kind of had to say yes. So went there, and he drove me over this great big bridge to get in there. And it was kind of more like a playground than a theme park. They had all of this furniture and things out of wood and they had little play things out of wood, but there weren’t really any rides per se. So we were for a little bit. He sat and he waited for me, and I took like I don’t know how long, a little while. And then I decided that I should call Elizabeth and see if she could come meet us here. And she wasn’t there, obviously, like she never is. And so then I was home and we were looking at this catalog at dresses and things and Mom was telling me that she had a dream about the chickens, and that they were eating, like they hadn’t eaten in two days because of seed. And I went out there and fed them, and they did that for me. There was a white one and a brown one, and they were eating out of my hand like feverishly. And I think that’s all there is."
734," Last night I had a really complicated dream that doesn’t make any sense, but I’ll try to put together the bits and pieces. First thing that I can remember is that I was walking down the street with Astrid, kind of early in the morning, and down at the end of  Avenue there’s  Street, and down there at  Street there’s a bus compound. I mean, there’s not really, but there was in my dream. And I could see the buses leaving from the bus compound, and there was a school bus that was coming to the house for me, and so I had to, Astrid and I just ran back to the house to try and beat them, but we didn’t make it. "
735," And, let’s see, oh, I dreamt that I had a chicken – Brenna – and she was like up here in the white bird cage, and I think she was there because there was something prowling around in the yard. And she’d been there a few days, so I decided that it was kind of time to take her out again. So I took her out and put her in the yard. "
736," And then lastly I dreamt that Dad and I were at the park reviewing psychology, and we found this bench to sit on, and there was this dog that was laying near the lake, just laying there and seemed just exhausted. We threw him some bread and he ate it, but other than that, he didn’t want to move. And then these other two dogs came running down the sidewalk, barking and yelping almost in unison. And they were just going over to that other dog, going to terrorize the heck out of him. And I stood up and yelled at them and ran them off, and they had collars, I think, because I heard them clinking. And Dad got up and went off and ran after them and he came back and he said he caught one of them and he had it in a covered box. And he said he was going to report the owner to the SPCA or something. And then I think I woke up. That doesn’t make any sense at all."
737," Last night I had kind of a mixed up dream. First I dreamt that Mom and I were at my college and going around to my classes, and it was like a holiday, so they had like stands where they had free food. And I was going around with a box collecting some, and Mom decided she was going to take it home. Let’s see, they had everything that they were giving away, even little bags of chicken nuggets, and I kind of, I excused myself because I had to go to class. We went out riding bikes and I was riding the tandem by myself and Mom and Dad were riding their bikes, and I was doing all kinds of silly stuff, like spinning around and around and around and around and kind of, you know, like that. And coming up to the point where the sidewalk changed, this is at South Bend Beach area, and I realized that they had gotten really far ahead of me, and that I should just catch up. And where the sidewalk changed there was this big round cover, and there were a bunch of little ones in front of it. And it was like I couldn’t go around it so I had to ______ down and walk over it, and the bike was so light I could pick it up and carry it. And I went until I caught up with them, and Dad had realized that my chain had fallen off, and he put it back on, and by then there was some lightning and thunder. And we were starting to turn around and head back home. Now I have a more vivid memory, and I remember when we turned around and headed back, the tandem was full-size again and I was on the back of it with Dad and we were riding home. And then the scene kind of like shifted, and I was here in my bed and it was dark, and I was listening to the radio, which in reality it didn’t come on yet, but in my dream it was on, and it was this techno-y rap kind of thing. And there was this scary techno song that had a s_____ score that goes, “Dee dee dee dee dee,” and then, “Bee bee bee bee bee bee bee,” and then, “Dee dee dee dee dee.” And in my dream it was just really scary because it had that interval in it, and so I reached over and I was changing it to something else, that was, I guess, something smoother and easier. And then I realized that there was this person in my bed, supposedly Mom. I had the feeling that I knew who it was. But the person’s skin was like wet, and I was thinking how it would be alright to listen to the techno-y song if Mom was there and I could hold her and all, but it was some person, maybe even a doll with wet skin, and so I had to get away from that scary thing and go to something else. And then I woke up and it was light out."
738,"  I had a very lucid dream last night, very lucid and very memorable. That is why it’s still with me in the middle of the day, because I was too lazy to go get another tape this morning. So that’s that. I don’t think I’d do as vivid of a description if I recorded it in the middle of unconsciousness, like when I first wake up. But anyway, last night I dreamt that Mom and I were walking home from someplace and we were talking about getting Dad this vintage collectible fire truck, remote control activated thing, for Christmas, you know, like the things Sam used to have. And we were saying how great it would be because it was nice and painted, and I had the notion that he collected fire memorabilia, but he doesn’t – Steve does. And so we were talking about getting that for him, but then I realized that when you make it back up, it does this stupid back-up alarm sound and that wouldn’t be good. So we decided not to get it for him. But, you know, he got it for himself, and I kind of had the notion in my mind that he had agreed to – I guess play with it while I wasn’t home, kind of like I blast the sound system while he’s not home. But anyway, in amongst all that ruckus I dreamt that I was watching a Celine Dion Las Vegas concert on Mom’s TV in her room, and I guess I think I remember watching her sing a song of some kind, kind of like a _______, something in Latin, in a black dress. And then the pace picked up a little bit, but instead of singing, for all her dancers and cast, she was like suggesting fashions that would look good on them, going around and giving them these clothes to change into. And this one girl got pants that were slightly longer than the shorts of the others, and she asked why and Celine politely put it that her thighs were a little big and she needed something longer to make them look prettier. And I don’t think that went over too well with the girl. And then, in the middle of the TV thing, I heard Dad’s fire truck thing that he supposedly got for himself in my dream, outside. Speaking of back-up alarms, there’s two of them going at the construction site across the street, but they’re not the scary kind. I don’t know if this will pick them up or not. They stopped now. But anyway, I heard his thing that we supposedly got for him outside in the back yard and I had the notion that he was running it in the dirt, and I couldn’t see it, and it was going, “Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo” and I could hear it from inside, so I was kind of like in a panic. And I went in my closet and I closed the door, and I sat and I covered my ears, but it was still the same level, in fact it was coming a little closer and getting a little louder. And he was even running his belt sander to cover up the sound so I wouldn’t hear it, and it was still audible to me. And, you know, in real life that wouldn’t be true. But soon after I woke up and I realized it was all a dream. They’ve been advertising the Hess  truck, you know, that they do every year on pretty much everywhere I’ve been listening, so maybe my subconscious was remembering the little truck that Brittany had that would make that crazy sound when it would back up. And Brittany was sensitive, though, she wouldn’t do it while I was around once she figured out that it scared me. In fact, she was trying and trying to turn the sound off of that thing. And I think I was combining those two. You know, I don’t know, I think that it’s one of those crazy things that just comes up as a figment of the imagination. I don’t think it means anything. One more thing, while I was cuing up a VS tape to record “American Dreams” last night, there was a Celine Oprah interview preview thing, and she was singing, and I had to put the tape on fast forward, but I wanted to watch the picture, so it was like, “do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-ahhh.” And I guess I was imagining all kinds of crazy things going on as I was watching the elaborate Las Vegas show go by really, really, really, really fast. And I think that’s it."
739,I had a really vivid dream that I was in a mansion watching a movie. Then I was at Sue's house and they were trying to replace their cat. It was much more detailed; I just can't remember it all now.
740," I think I had a dream about walking into outer space last time, but I’m not really for certain. I’m not sure if it was a real plane or a Disneyland ride, but it was something that I was flying in, like some kind of tour or something. And we were like shooting up, you know how that goes. And there was like this tour guide that was talking and saying something about how we go up into the atmosphere and we’re in this dark realm where we can see the planets and things, and then we go up further and we actually escape the earth’s gravitational force. And it’s like, this doesn’t make sense, man, if you can see the earth and you’re out of its gravitational force, but I guess it’s the orbit that I’m thinking of. We could be in orbit and see the planet, but still be in its gravity and then shoot way far out in the middle of nowhere and then be out of orbit and just spinning free. So that was a messed up dream with nothing to it, I guess."
741," I had kind of an interesting dream last night, but this is one that I don’t really see the sense in yet. I dreamt that I was working on DP or something to that effect. It was some other kind of program that was kind of similar, but instead of just being in my studio here on the west wall, my machine was set up on a little wobbly table inside my closet, and I only had a little bit of elbow room one way or another. And the light from the monitor kept it from being too dark in there. And somehow I had a little bit of some kind of sound system in there. And I’m trying to think now, what happened. Oh, I think before any of this I had lent my machine to Terri, I mean the whole shebang, the monitor and everything, because hers is one of those all-in-one things and hers was down and out for whatever reason, and she had this paper thing she had to finish for her job, and so I lent it to her. And she brought it back to me and was setting it up in my closet like I needed it to be. And, let’s see, I didn’t feel claustrophobic in my closet. I felt okay, and I seemed to be content in that little mess. I was still a little crowded out, but I was okay, other than that. And I can’t remember much else. Oh, I know. The scene kind of like shifted all of a sudden, and I was in the church, and instead of listening to just eight or ten magical singers, I was listening to this great big, huge choir singing and accompanied by an organ. And their songs were all right, but they weren’t that impressive. Things are never as impressive as they should be in dreams, for some reason. Whenever I would dream of opening presents, usually they’re like boring things. And things are just usually not as exciting in dreams as in reality. But maybe that’s for the fear that they won’t be. And that’s all I can really remember. I think the thought of working comfortably in my closet relates to the fact that I think I would be just fine if I were by myself and nobody knew, like what I was doing or how much time I was spending on one thing, and I was just working along at my own pace, twiddley-dee, twiddley-da . And I guess lending my machine to Terri is something kind of literal. I wrote the Christmas wish letter for her, and hers is like so old, running always ., bless her heart, she can’t even get online. And I’ve offered that if she needs to run around on a faster platform, she’s done enough printing for me, she should come over and run around on a faster platform for a little while. But I guess that’s just some crazy thing that entered my mind."
742," Last night I had kind of a fragmented, kind of mixed up dream, but I guess it had some kind of sense. I was first, and most prominently, even though I think it was last, I dreamt that I had to go back to my high school for some reason, I didn’t know why. But then I went in this office that was kind of dark and it had several layers in it, like it had several steps down in places, like the sound both at Ace Field. And I realized that it was the VE Specialist’s office and I had to talk to Ms. Coombs. And I told her that I’m not back here to take any more academic classes. I’ve already graduated. I’m back here, I think it was to take chorus class or something, which I guess that would be explainable because I’m working closely with Mrs. Dougherty and I’m volunteering at my high school and I have one of my high school’s volunteer ID’s. And then Ms. Coombs finally got it and then Mrs. Hollander came up, and I was practicing speaking Spanish to her, and I was telling her that Mom will be there with her painting on Monday, and different stuff like that. And from what I remember about what I was speaking, it was correct grammatically. And, let’s see, what else? Oh, before any of that, I was here in my bedroom with this really long tape that was given to me like in the four track format that the Library of Congress records in, and it was this kids’ cartoon tape about different historic events that happened. It was about Christopher Columbus and his Spanish friend that came to America, and they were just being real goofy and silly on the tape. And I was trying to get to the part, I guess it was the other side of the tape that was talking about reading music, and Mrs. Dougherty wanted me to listen to it. But there was so much of this Christopher Columbus goofiness that I didn’t get to the other part. I can’t remember too much more, but I have this vague memory that me and four other people were in this crowded little store like an antique shop, but we were practicing singing in there. We were each dressed up as a different character, which they were last night, and there was an accompanist there kind of leading us. And we sang something and like everybody started crying, and I didn’t and I was wondering what was the big sad thing here. I couldn’t figure it out. And I think that’s all."
743,"Ok first I remember I was sitting in some chair out in space. There was also a missile that was floating near me. I was with one other person who was also sitting in their own chair. I remember I pressed some button and the missile rotated, I had a sudden feeling of dread come over me as if I miscalculated and the missile was not pointing the right way. Now I am suddenly in my apartment and I realize I am dreaming. I immediately walk over to the wall and stick my hand through it to make sure I am really dreaming. My hand goes all the way through. Then I jump out of the window and I am flying over the street, that gets boring so I go back inside. While I am still aware of my ""lucid powers"" I believe at this point I have lost ludicity. Meaning I still can go through walls and what not but I don't realize it's because I am dreaming, I infact think I am having an out of body experience in the dream. I go through the wall thinking it's the wall my my friend's apartment. When I get in there room I see them lying in bed and wonder if they can see me. I finally realize they can't and I fly around their room looking at things. Of course it looks nothing like their real room. That's really all I remember, the whole walking through walls thing was pretty cool."
744," I had a dream about sound last night, and now I’ve just got to remember what it was. We were at this place like the Grays Point or Beeker Park, and they were having this kind of little festival thing with cupcakes and different little craft booths and different things going on. And there was this little area only reserved for VIP’s and only VIP people could go there. And it had this little orange net fencing surrounding it, you know like they do sometimes at blockade sites. Well, there was a gap in the orange net fencing and Dad was putting bulb  and just ___ back there. We didn’t know it was only for VIP’s and we didn’t have a pass, and once we got back there, everybody was very accommodating to us. And we went up on this deck and we saw some sound equipment, like a couple mike stands and a couple amps and mixers and things laying around. And that was pretty cool, but then the deck was like the deck of a house or something that had a door on the front, like the front door of a house. But when you went in this front door, it would be really, really dark with only a little window at the top. And it was a narrow hallway, and it was deep. I mean, I should say it was a deep way down from the deck to the floor, and there was a window up high. The doors had windows in them. And the window light reflected against the wall and it looked gray. And we go down this tunnel. Well, first of all, in my dream I like was in a hurry to get in this door because there was a lot of sophisticated equipment in there, or so I thought. And I think this is an important part of the dream. And I went in the door and let it close behind me, I was so scared and petrified that it was so dark, that I opened the door and I waited a few minutes for Dad to come with me. And he came with me and we, it seemed a little lighter when he was there with me. And boy, I’m using up tape like crazy here. Why I can’t stop stuttering and la la la blah. Oh well, anyway, it seemed lighter when he was down there, and there was some kind of a sound system in there that had a couple of subs that went, “boom, boom, boom” with some kind of rap beat, you know how it goes in those big cars? Except it wasn’t that intense; it was about the level of mine, but it was just kind of isolated and not a whole lot of highs or anything else. And I thought, “Hey, that’s cool,” and I had a feeling like it was like a testing site. And went down this hall and we came out. It led into like a nice little shop thing, and this shop had everything from like candy canes to little ornament ball things, to baskets of goodies and stuff. And I had a feeling it was like somebody’s house, but it was a shop too, and there was a lady there that was real nice and kind and accommodating to us, and gave us something, I don’t remember what, from her kitchen table, something like a sample to eat. And then we went out the door and we were back at the Beeker Park place, and Dad said, “Want to do that again?” and I said, “Yeah.” So we stepped into the orange fencing, we went up on the little deck, I saw the equipment up on the deck, we went down in the little dark tunnel thing with the subs that were booming and went through the lady’s little shop, and, hey, that was fun. It was like a round, round, round circle. We did it a couple times. And then I had Astrid with me and Dad, and I was leading Astrid up onto the deck and down into the little dark tunnel thing, and the tunnel thing seemed lighter and safer each time I went through it. I think that’s symbolic. And this time I was leading Astrid through it, and I lead her, she wasn’t scared at all, of course. Well, even though she couldn’t see, she knew it was kind of dark in there and cramped and tight, and she didn’t seem to have a problem with it. And then I led her into the shop thing, except it had transformed this time, and not only was it that lady’s shop, it was like somebody’s bedroom. And we were like snooping in somebody’s bedroom and they had a whole stack of CD’s and stuff, and Astrid was wanting me – and all of these CD’s were new, they were wrapped, like the shrink wrap. And Astrid was telling me, “Tell me what this one is, tell me what this one is,” and some of the titles I could read and some I couldn’t. And just before I woke up, there was this CD that had the cover of like a green spider web, and it had white lettering on it that said “ cents,” you know, like the rapper guy. And then I woke up. Man, that was something. And, you know, it’s evening time and it stayed with me the whole day. Isn’t that amazing! But I think this is kind of symbolic. In the past I have had a few dreams about a roundy-roundy-round circle that just is continuous, like, for example, I had a dream one time that a cellar went down into a sub-cellar that led out into a, like a netting tube that you would go up and get in the attic. And when you were in the attic, there would be a whole bunch of stuffed animals and it would be kind of hard to breathe in there. And you would have to fight your way through tons and tons and tons of stuff in order to get out of there. It was kind of like Mom’s attic is. And then you would be in the house, and that was a circle that involved dark and scary places. Now this circle had a dark and scary place, but it was only one, and it involved sound, which makes me think about life when I analyze this. The fact that the tunnel seemed lighter and safer each time I went through it, I think has to do with experiences that are new and odd and scary. They seem easier each time I have the same experience, and I think the first time that I went in there when I was so scared and petrified and I waiting for Dad, I think some experiences are like that. I am afraid to do them on my own, and even though he’s more critical and slower and harder, I want to have somebody help me through them. And I think the lady’s shop symbolizes like a house, like almost being in a home-like environment. I don’t know, I’m drawing a blank there. But the fact that I had Astrid on this round circle thing with me, I think is that I think I’ve had enough in the sound industry that I can start leading Astrid through it. And that’s all I have to say for now. My throat is dry and I’ve used up enough tape. Another thing I thought of, I think the fact that we started out that an event at Beeker Park or the Grays Point and going in that VIP section and people not minding us just barging in there has to do with the fact that coming into the sound industry in all this stuff, I started not knowing a darned thing and being at events like that, at public places, and wanting to go behind and wanting to just jump over those stupid fence things, and wanting to go talk to the people and they never really minded it. And that, inside the VIP fence is like inside another world. And I think – I don’t know if this circle was about life, or if it was about the other world contained in the sound industry, or whether it’s about both. I don’t know, but that’s that."
745,"First part of the dream, I'm in my apartment  and there is a bad rain storm outside. I can hear thunder. It gets closer and louder and at one point I believe lightening actually hit the building I was in. It was SOOO loud. . I cringed each time the lightening struck, and finally the storm moved off. Then I remember I was telling someone about the storm and that the building I was in got hit. They didn't believe me and I told them that one time when I was young lightening hit right next door to our house so I think I would know.  Now I am in another place and we all decide to drop some E. Knowing I usually get sick when I take E i wanted to hurry home so I wouldnt get sick in the car. I am driving down the highway which then changes into a bunch of people walking on the highway. I almost hit some kid but finally get away and head home. I get near my house and end up at my friend CHris' house, just outside. Her front door  is at the bottom of this huge hill, I start running up the hill and then I run into some other guy who stops me and starts talking to me. Then he bugs me about my weight and said I needed to lose some and that it was gross. I was like dude, why should I give a fuck what you think? Then I woke up."
746," Last night I had a dream that was kind of involved, but I only remember bits and pieces of it now. First I was in a group of singers, a special little group that Mrs. Dougherty had put together, and we were practicing singing, “What Child Is This,” but somehow nobody else sang and I ended up singing it like a solo. And she was saying “Good job” to everybody, even though nobody else sang. That was funny. And I think we were getting some kind of stage ready for some kind of performance. We were deciding who was going to be where and what we were going to do. And then she took me aside and she asked me, she told me that she knows how to read music on a staff, but she wanted to know how do you read music in the form of mini data in an arrangement window, you know, like with the vertical keys and the lines and the grid and stuff. Well, that’s what I was going to teach her how to read. And I was going to write a little book on that at home, but I was having a tough time finding some paper. And there were some other things going on. I think somebody wanted me to hurry up and get out of the house with them to go somewhere, and I didn’t have time to make this book. And just before I woke up, I was writing out part of it. I remember something else about this dream now. This was a really important part. I don’t know how I could forget. I dreamt that the phone rang or something and called me away from what I was doing, and I had to leave my computer like at the desktop, the Mac. And I ran to the phone and got called away, or something, and when I came back, I found Dad sitting in my chair getting into my folder of word processing, all my journal and stuff, and just reading. For some reason he sized the window down to a little tiny, tiny thing and he was just reading, and he said, “I see you _____ a word processor here. Why would you be doing that?” And I’m thinking, “Ahhhh, this is the death of me!” And I finally convinced him that he shouldn’t be looking at that, that that’s a private thing, and somehow I didn’t need to give any more of an explanation. Then some older lady was working with me and she took me online to get something, I don’t know what, but something audio that was playing through the task scan, and somehow she shut me down without getting me offline, and usually in the world, you just automatically get offline when you shut down, if you don’t already. But I was all up in arms that I hadn’t been disconnected from the line, and so she had to start up all over again and get me offline and shut down. And I don’t know what happened after that."
747,"I had a horrible dream last night! First, Lord Voldemort was after me and I couldn't hide from him. I tried to run outside my house in the woods. He heard me and went back inside to get a flashlight for some reason. Then I ran up by the Links' house and Mr. Links came back with his flashlight. He found me, so I made a deal with him that if he stopped killing everyone else, he could kill me. It was so scary. Then I had a dream that we bought a new dog crate, not even a new dog, but just a new crate. It was a huge deal for some reason. I couldn't understand why everyone was so worked up, but whatever. So that ended and then I dreamed that it was exam time again at school. The new policy was that you could either take the exam in the classes you were taking, or you could pick up a new class and take that exam. So I decided to pick up dance and take that exam --it was a lot of fun! But ever since I had picked it up and had to dance with Julian, Lou stopped talking to me. It was unbearable and I couldn't understand why he was ignoring me. So for the exam, I had to have sex with Julian. I was really reluctant to do this, but I was guaranteed an A in the class and that I wouldn't even remember having sex with him, so I did. But the next morning, I was really sore and I did remember everything. Lou came up behind me and started flirting with me again, and I was so happy he wasn't ignoring me. I ran up to him and tried to hug him. Then he pushed me away, and I was really confused. I asked him what his problem was, and he said something to the effect of, ""At least I didn't sleep with someone to get a good grade. I don't want you sleeping with other boys."" I guess it was cute that he cared, but it was horrible having him mad at me!"
748," Last night I had what I guess they would call a guilty taddle telling dream because it shows off what I know and it can’t be hidden from me. And, okay, I dreamt that we were babysitting that girl Annie from the Barrett’s house and she’s kind of an immature kind of blah kind of person, and she had this program, you know, like they give out in the theaters, that kind of program, for this Brian Adams concert that I’m supposed to go to for Christmas. And I asked her if she could tell me what the date was that the performance was going to be, and she didn’t really know how to count; she kept getting all mixed up. She kept telling me, “, ,” and I kept telling her, “I think you mean /.” And she’s like, “Oh no, it says here , .” Wonder what that can mean? And she was opening it up, and for some reason it had all these stickers in it and her ticket, and I don’t know what the stickers were for. They were like hearts and flowers and teddy bears. And I couldn’t really read the date; it was too small. And then I went into the kitchen and there was this thing sitting on the counter, and I picked it up and I thought it was a piece of chocolate. And I took a little taste of it, and it was lipstick, and I was like, “Bleah!” And I’ve never really done that, so I don’t know where that came from. And then I was coming out to ride the bike with Dad, and I had this dress on that came to my mid thighs, and it was really cold, but I had this dress on. And I don’t know why, and I was going to ride the bike in this dress. And that’s all I can remember. I think I woke up after that, but I don’t know."
749," Last night I had quite an absurd dream. I dreamt that after my exams were over and I was in my last meeting of Electronics class, Mr. Martin kind of really like surprised us and said that he wanted to take us all on a trip to the beach and stay there overnight, and so that we could look at the sunset and the wave length and the frequencies of light and how they change. And I was really surprised that we were going without any further notice, without any bags, without any anything. And so the kids in the class didn’t really want me to go because they were afraid that I would get lost, that I wouldn’t know where I was going and what I was doing, and stuff like that, like I’ve always had to deal with. And I was just kind of bull-headed and assertive and said that I’ve been to the beach lots of time with my family and that this will be nothing. And so next thing I know, I was there and we were all sitting around and talking and I was swimming with them in the water. And we just kind of swam around and I guess we stayed the night; I don’t even remember too much. But when we got back to the house, it didn’t even look like what I’m used to. It was this big, fancy, ornate lobby which they’re known for and I had to get something out of his class, so I had to go upstairs. Oh, for some reason we were sitting in his classroom that was more like a living room, and it was dark and we were just all talking about the trip and what a wonderful time we had. And then we all went out and I was kind of going in the opposite direction of all the people and waiting for a minute or two because there was this whole table full of candy. They had like big dishes with lids on them, and I’m sure that anybody could just go in there and get some. But then I kind of lost interest. They hung around and they hung around, and I figured I had to get home and I think at the time I had the cell phone in my pocket, and I turned it on in case they needed to locate where I was. And they had this – it must have been three stories, but it was real open and each story had real high ceilings – and there was this roundy roundy round, real narrow staircase, just about my arm span wide. So I was hanging on, each hand to a railing on each side of this running down these stairs and spiraling around and around until I finally, I didn’t even get to the bottom and I heard them calling my name on the intercom. And I couldn’t really say anything or yell out that I was on the stairs or anything, and the office was right in front of the staircase. And the office had clear doors like the Learning Support Center does. And I can’t remember actually reaching the bottom, but I remember being in the office and meeting up with Dad and not knowing what was going to happen after that. And then I woke up."
750," Last night I had a really crazy dream. First I dream that, in addition to my three classes out at my college, I was taking a fourth one here at my high school, like a dual enrollment thing. So what I was supposed to do is go to my high school, be at that class from like : to : o’clock, then go out to my college and be at the next class by :. So this class was taught by Ms. Arlo, which was the teacher that I had my first semester of the  grade, and she was strange, bizarre, bland, and I could never figure her out. She taught critical thinking and learning skills, which was a really boring, stupid course. But in my dream she was teaching that class again, and I had to take her class at the college level, and it was like a dual enrollment thing, I guess. And Elizabeth was there, and I think I went to the first class, but I didn’t go to that class any more after that. In my dream I only had three classes at my college and I only went to those three classes. And in my dream I had no idea what my classes were at my college, and I got a notice in the mail and a little card that had my exam score from Ms. Arlo, and I had gotten a “D” on her exam. And I was thinking to myself, “Now gee, I don’t even remember taking that exam. I don’t even remember having that class, so what’s up with this grade?” Then I remembered I had the class, but I skipped it, all but one day, and I didn’t take the exam. And then the scene kind of changed and I was at this picnic party that I think was at like the remote park like Lake Sumner, and we were – it might have even been Jenny Springs, I’m not sure, but we were by some water and it was kind of a nice even temperature – not real cold and not real warm. And there were trees around and there were picnic tables all over everywhere. And it was somebody’s birthday. And there was this guy I knew who was kind of like my best friend, and there was supposed to be Elizabeth’s family and some fireman people in the neighborhood. We were going to all get together for this man’s birthday. Anyway, I had the Peavey system. Where I got power for it, I don’t know. Don’t ask me. But anyway, that wasn’t an issue in my dream. It was just supposed to run. And, let’s see, there was a birthday cake, and here’s the funny part: I had borrowed Astrid’s keyboard because somebody was going to play and I didn’t know how to, and it was set up and connected to the Peavey system and this guy was just jamming away, whose birthday it was. I didn’t know who he was. And then I went off to do something else. I think I was running streamers from one tree to another. And then, before I knew it, I was back at the guy, and the thing turned into a cake. And I’m thinking, “Oh, my gosh, what’s Astrid going to say?” That was crazy. And that was a cake and everybody was cutting up and having a piece. Oh geez. And then the scene suddenly shifted and I was at this movie theater setting up the Peavey system there. There was supposed to be some kind of screening of some kind, some kind of VIP party, and things were really, really running late and it was kind of like I was going to be sitting around for the next few hours waiting for people. And then I woke up. That was a strange conglomeration of things. Also another funny part as this dream was ending and I was waking up and fading into consciousness and coming to, I thought back about my classes at my college, and I was thinking, “Could I have really gotten that grade on that exam or what here?” And I couldn’t remember any of my classes. I had to think about when was my lunch hour. Then I remembered I had Electronics class, then I remembered Music and Computers class, and then I woke up a little more and remembered Psychology, but I couldn’t remember the first one. And it wasn’t until I was like fully awake for a few minutes that I remembered, oh, it was Business Law, which I was a little doubtful of how I was going to do on that exam, so that might be where this dream got started. Also another part of this dream could have come from the fact than when I interned at Ace Field, during the baseball games they’d have all kinds of corporate plugs, people could win things and advertise a corporation. And Sam Ash Music sponsored a happy birthday thing for every game, and they would tell the birthdays of famous people. And they would show the organist’s fingers playing “Happy Birthday” and then suddenly the picture would materialize into a birthday cake with a Sam Ash Music picture on it, so that might be a seed of that thought."
751," Last night I was dreaming that I had three classes to go to and that they were in the afternoon. The first one started at like :, and why I keep dreaming about having to go to classes, don’t ask me. I’m sick of dreaming that. But anyway, my first one started at : and it was like : and Mom was sitting at the dining table just writing and stuff like that, and I was telling her, “You should go get the truck and bring it around. I’m going to be late for class.” And she said, “No you won’t; you’ll be fine.” But it got to the point where I was shaking her by the shoulders and yelling and crying, telling her to get moving because I was going to be really late for class. And it was kind of hard because I was just screaming. And I can’t remember, but I think it was like, “Yeah, yeah, yeah,” kind of blah. Then I was in this party room with these people and it was supposed to be something like a dance performance thing. It was going to be filmed on live TV and I was just kind of in the audience with the people. And it was a small room with a kind of a wooden floor, and it was, I think it was for the show “Fame” and I had the notion that “Crispen” won it last year—who the heck Crispen is, I don’t know. And I was going in and out this room and going to the bathroom and few times, and then I came back and I was sitting around with people and they were talking about what they were going to do. And this one girl was doing some homework and needed to use bright  calculator, and it was really acting funny and we couldn’t figure out why. And then suddenly I was, it was Dad out at this little tiny building that I guess resembled the church that we had the party at, but it was more like a movable portable facility than that. And we had to go there for some kind of business, but I wasn’t real keen on going in there because I had heard that their alarm system was real unreliable and could pretty much go off at any time when somebody so much as shook the place the wrong way. And so I stood back a few feet while they opened the door, and things were okay in there. And in my dream I really had to go to the bathroom, but I didn’t want to because I was afraid that sitting down on the toilet and going would either make the alarm off or I would be lucky enough to be in there when, just happen to. So I didn’t, I kept walking around for a little bit, doing different things, getting stuff ready for some kind of event. And I finally went to the bathroom, and then I woke up, and I had to go when I woke up."
752,"My first dream was that it was exam time and I had taken every exam except for Spanish. For Spanish, I had to clone people. Jackson was right in front of me doing the same thing. The clones came from every room, and it was impossible to keep track of them. Finally, Sra. Perez said we had made enough and that we could leave. I had had a lot of feelings towards Jackson lately. He brought me into Tinker into an empty room. We weren't doing anything except kissing, but the whole time in there felt really sexual. He had his shirt off or something, but it felt like we were doing more than just kissing, even though we weren't Anyway, we were there for awhile before the person who lived there came back and kicked us out. We were holding hands as we left. We went to the library to start studying for another exam, which was weird since we were done with our exams. Then we had Fun Friday. It was the weirdest one ever, but it was everyone's favorite. There was a monster onstage plus  students. The monster could see one person, but not the other two. We all had to kill the monster, but the more people that came on stage, the more the monster could see us. He could also hear us. I remember looking at my watch and realizing an hour had gone by. Then I woke up."
753,"I dreamed that I had bought the brand new Synergy hockey stick, and I couldn't wait to use it. There was a pick up hockey game some winter night when we were getting snowed in. When I picked up, however, I realized that I had bought a righty instead of a lefty. I was so disappointed at myself for my foolish mistake. No matter how hard I tried, the stick stayed righty. All the other girls laughed at me. Then I started a new dream that was at my brother's  grade parent-teacher conferences. I was really bored and kept falling asleep until the teacher used me as an example of the student who had perfectly gotten through elementary and middle school, and that I was doing excellent now as well. Then another woman engaged me in a conversation about Pirates of the Caribbean but I fell asleep . Then I woke up in real life."
754," This is Christmas Eve, . Last night I had kind of a hodgepodge dream of various different things. I don’t know what came first, but I’ll start with what I remember best. I dreamt that I was in this group of people. I think we were either singers or performers or something. And we were in a band room and we were kind of being taught by a man, but instead of rehearsing or stuff, we were talking about Greek mythology and we were talking about how to go around and take the path and the journey to find Theseus . I guess the ____ stories are going to my head. And so we decided we were going to take this little jaunt, trip so maybe we would finally understand how it went. And Mom was kind of volunteering with that and she came back to get me because everybody kind of left me behind. And everybody was going on their way and Mom was driving me in this van that is like the yellow cab van, except it wasn’t yellow, it was brown. And it had like a two-way radio in it and I could hear Sparky talking. He’s the cab dispatcher. And, oh, Mom was showing me that she bought these pins of like different figures for people to wear, and I was like dressed in this costume. And I don’t remember ever getting there. And before that, I dreamt that I was investigating around by the tree, and that I had a longer, a box that was longer than it was wide and kind of not that high, and heavy and dense, and it was wrapped in green paper. Now I don’t know if this is a prophetic image or if it’s just wishful thinking, but I tend to believe it’s just wishful thinking. And now I don’t remember any more."
755,"I dreamed that I was PERFECT in every way: looks, sports, brains, personality, talent, etc. I was perfect. So I was running around with this really tall, dark, handsome guy. We were by the ocean and he said he'd love me forever. Then I realized I was just a character for a John Updike story, so I was really scared and wanted to see the ending, but I was woken up instead for Christmas."
756,"I remember a portion of this dream. I was in my apartment  and some people were over and they were about to leave, but I didn't want them to go. I seemed to be feeling very sorry for myself in the dream. As the last friend goes to walk out the door I make a comment like ""Life really sucks"" which makes her come back in and talk to me. Obviously I said it just to get her to stay. Another portion I remember there was this bees nest outside of my apartment and we wanted to figure out how to get rid of them. We did something to make them leave their nest, I remember seeing them all fly off, they didn't try to sting us or anything. "
757,"First I dreamed that I was babysitting Layla. I was trying to do everything perfectly since her dad was my soccer coach. We went to the ocean and came back to her house to bake cookies. We were just rolling out the dough when her mom came back and paid me. Next, I was in some really fancy modern Japanese-style house. Every time I finished a homework assignment, I was allowed to get up and get a piece of candy. The thing was --the assignments never seemed to end. No sooner would I finish one then I would have another one. Finally it was study hall and I was working with Ava, Isaiah, and Beth. It was weird because I think Isaiah liked me. Then I woke up."
758," Last night I had kind of a whacky dream. I dreamt that I was attending this special school for like handicapped people, I guess because they were an institution known to do a lot of help for people and make a lot of things go well for people, and so they thought it would be good for me to go and visit them and see what they could do for me. And, believe it or not, it was like this private school, K-, and since this was my first year with them, they put me in a first grade class. And I went to this first grade class for two days, I think, and then I realized that this was not just a health institution that would try to help you. This was a school that they were going to try to put you through their twelve years of education no matter how old or young you were, and how many you’d already been through. And then the scene kind of shifted, and I was like, I had a place that I had, somebody had given me. It was a dinky little apartment thing, and I was living on my own. Actually I was living on my own part of the time and living at home part of the time. And I was in this dinky little apartment getting some work done and stuff, and I called home and it was : in the evening and Mom and Dad were like, “Where the heck are you? If you’re going to leave the house, you tell us first.” They didn’t even know I had this place. And then I was, I think it was the next day, and I was going back to this place, I was going to bring them my high school diploma, show them that I had already graduated, show them that I was in college now and disconnect myself from them. So I went in the office and I had my high school diploma, and I chatted with the ladies; they seemed really nice. And I just told them, “I don’t wish to take any more classes here. Thank you.” And I walked out, and I showed them, and they seemed so impressed. I couldn’t figure out what were they so impressed about? And I think shortly thereafter I was kind of in the phase of stage  sleep and waking up, and I was thinking how, I had the notion that the campus that I attended now of my college was really called Panella’s Park High and it just had facilities for college students in the back forty, kind of like. But when I was fully awake, I realized that I was still attending my college. How come I keep having dreams about these educational conflicts? I keep dreaming that I’m back at my high school or that I’m not really where I am yet, I think because it’s still for me to even believe."
759,"I dreamed that there was some sort of Olympics at school. There were  big events. Halfway through one I ran to Taylor for some reason just to hang out, I guess. Next day I was watching the real Olympics. I realized I had hockey practice, so I ran to Bundy to get ready. I was really panicked because I couldn't find my watch or something. When I got there, someone had died. We had this huge underclassmen funeral. Then I was in a department store of some sort. Someone else was with me and there were these two sort of scary-looking men, who wanted to buy us jewelry. We found two pairs of earrings we liked, and they went to buy them for us. The woman at the counter said they were Tiffany earrings, but somehow I couldn't believe her. There were  little dogs there too and they were yapping all over the place. So then I was at Hogwarts. Professor Snape was looking all over the place for me. I accidentally set off a charm that made all these bombs explode. The whole school rushed into the hallways. We had to bring as much money outside as possible. It was freezing outside. But then I woke up."
760,"I dreamed that Jackson and I were on a bus on the way home from my elementary school. He jumped out of the bus to run to my house. It was pouring rain, so we had to change into dry clothes. I was changing when he walked in and saw me. I wasn't embarrassed, for some reason. But there was something I was trying to hide in my closet, so I was worried that he would find it. Then I woke up."
761," Last night I had a whacky dream. I dreamt that Mom and I were coming home from a trip to my relative’s home town and we were outside the airport and Josie and Bobby and Christine and Larry and her and I were opening gifts. And the plane was going to leave in five minutes. Then it came down to that we missed the plane because we were opening gifts, and I figured, “Okay, we’re just going to have to stay in my relative’s home town for a few more hours until the next outgoing flight.” And that was kind of good because we could go to somebody’s house and stay a little longer. Well, it just so happened that – I know this is very unrealistic – but Dad drove all the way up from my home town because he somehow found out that we missed the plane. See, we were going to tell him that our flight was cancelled, but somehow he found out that we missed the plane. And so he drove up and he was going to get us and bring us home, and he was mad, mad, mad at that old red hen, hen, hen. And we also missed the Bryan Adams concert and I was jumping up and down and saying that, “You have to take me to an equivalent one.” Something else, but I can’t remember. And that’s basically it. When I was waking up and realized that all this was a dream and that missing the plane was a dream and the concert was still on, I was real relieved."
762,I dreamed that I was in this train station going to a concert with my whole chemistry class. That's all I can remember.
763,"I dreamed that I was back in  grade and had to make a poster about the solar system. So I made it and brought it into school. The presentations were held in the lunchroom. The presentations started and I realized how inadequate my work was. So I shifted my posters around until I found the best one I had made about the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment. I used that and presented, and did very well. Then I had some dream about Jackson, that I was talking to him through a wall. I also dreamed I woke up next to him. Then I woke up."
764," Last night I had two really funny dreams. The first one, I had the notion that I was interning at some kind of TV station like Time Warner, yet it was kind of like the Dome at where I was. And I think it was, I couldn’t really figure out what it was, but I was in this control room and I had like all kinds of video equipment and a small mixing board in the back. And there was this real crowd of people in there. I couldn’t figure out who they were, but this one guy was supposed to be the manager and his name was Sam, kind of like the guy we missed at Wussaker  Hall, and there were a couple of guys that I thought I know, and there was a whole bunch of people that I didn’t even know that I was kind of wondering why the heck were they there. And we were supposed to get this show on the road, and I was supposed to help somebody with something. And there were about four or five people crowded behind the board trying to do all do the same thing at once. Gee, where have I heard this before? And, of course, I was just kind of sitting in a little corner observing all this commotion and ruckus going on, and then I kind of faded into another scene where I was walking down the sidewalk and I had to go through an obstacle course. And I was trying to tell somebody about my experience when I was going through an obstacle course. And one of the things I had to go through – I didn’t really have to go through anything but this one thing. In front of Jean’s house where she has that fence, white picket fence, it kind of came out to the sidewalk and enclosed and made a box, and I had to crawl in the box and they close the door and then open it on the other side so I could get out. So when they closed the box, it was so small and tight, I could barely move through it, and there was a top on it like I was in a bunny cage. And then I came out the other side of the bunny cage and I went on my way and I was okay. But when I was in the bunny cage, I thought I’d never get out of it. I think this came from when I was like  and used to sit in the bunny cage and feed the bunny, but I never used to mind because I could get out from the inside. Anyway, the next little dream I had after I kind of woke up from it and went to the bathroom and stuff, is that I was back at my high school again – I can’t get away from dreaming about my high school and other schools I’ve been to . But anyway, it was either – I think it was a cross between my high school and my elementary school. And I was skating on roller skates through the hallway, I think because I was just there to kind of help out with something. I wasn’t really there to actually go. And I can’t remember too much except I was in PE class again, and we were doing jumping jacks out in the courtyard thing. And, you know, I can’t remember anything more. That’s a bummer."
765,"In this dream I was at my mom's house . Me and a friend dropped some E but it never really kicked in. Then I remember trying to call someone and I couldn't seem to get through to them . I was pissed so I started banging the phone against the receiver and ended up breaking it. Oops. I was worried my mom would be upset since it's her phone. Then my mom and a bunch of other people come in, I start freaking out  because I knew I had dropped E and didn't want them to know. I didn't want to be all high in front of them. I was very stressed out by this. That's all I remember."
766,"I dreamed that my brother and I were electricians of some sort and had to install TVs into houses/trailers in a trailer park. It was scary because the trailer park was next to a chemical plant, so it was always releasing chemicals and other horrible things into the air. And it was really loud. The trailer we were working on was constructed like an airplane. My brother and I tried to figure out how to fly it, but couldn't. So then I dreamed it was exam period. I had an  math exam, but for some reason instead of going to the classroom, I went to the movie theater to see Love Actually. This didn't seem at all weird though. Caroline went in and told me she'd save me a seat while I went to get ice cream. I wanted Butterscotch ice cream, and there was only one vendor that had it. My mother was in the line ahead of me. As soon as it was my turn, the woman closed everything up. I was really annoyed and went upstairs. All these junior and senior boys I didn't know were there. I really wanted this butterscotch ice cream, but no one had it. Instead I just had some diet coke. Everyone was leaving the movie theater, so I guess I missed the movie. I found my friends and realized that my dress had fallen off. I left hurriedly, thinking it was just a trick of my mind, hoping it was just a trick of my mind. I saw Lou walking out of the dining all. He was carrying something and his hair was really short. I noticed he was wearing these terrible looking shoes, and I decided that I should stop liking him for that reason. I went back to my friends and all of a sudden I was looking into a deep abyss, like where Mordor is in Lord of the Rings. I ran away as fast as I could and ran into my math teacher, who noticed I had missed the exam! Thank god I woke up!"
767,"I dreamed that Sue and I were in a car together. Isabel called our Spain program to see if she got in. They said she had. So then I called to ask if I got in, and they said I hadn't, but that there was a program in Russia if I was interested. For some reason if I wanted to go to Russia, I had to learn Latin, which wouldn't have been so bad. I remember telling myself that this was a dream and waking myself up."
768," Last night I had kind of a strange dream, that for some reason we were going to a Giants game, but I wasn’t going to like do any DJ’ing or anything like that. I was going to like sit and watch the game, and we were hoping that I could like sit in the press box and go to the sound booth or something like that. And we were describing who we were and Mom just casually mentioned that I graduated from high school. And the lady whisked us and said, “Here, let’s put you in the graduate section.” And there was a VIP area for people who had graduated from high school. And she took us off down this little hall and brought us in this little booth. It was kind of like a sound-proof booth. And they passed out – there were like five of us in there and there was one lady. I was sitting up on a high stool so that I could actually see down and out the window what was going on. And, of course, I couldn’t always see what was going on in the field, but I could see all the people in the bleachers and stuff. And this lady was like in her ’s, and she was like, “Can I trade with you?” And so I sat on the far right, down on the lowest stool I could, and I couldn’t even see up above the window. And she sat in the middle in between like the five of us. There were like three boys and only two girls. And she passed out like snacks and little prizes to us; it was like complimentary things that came with being in that section. And we were supposed to get to hear all kinds of like inside stuff, but they didn’t send it over our system. Ours – and get this – this was the craziest part – the system that they had us hear did not carry the songs that, the periodic songs and announcements that Bobby mixed, and apparently we were just supposed to watch the game without sound. And they played teenage rap and R&B stuff over the system that we heard. And that was crazy. I wanted to hear Bobby’s mix. And I was thinking about how, when I was there at regular games in the sound booth, and I got to listen in on him talking about what to do and when to do it, I missed hearing all that because that was like really the inside scoop, the ultimate inside scoop. And, of course, to be able to coordinate it to listening to Bobby’s mix and looking at the monitor when I could see what the video person was doing. And also there’s another part to this dream that I remember. Before any of that, I dreamt that I was having a sleep-over birthday party with Astrid and Linda and Joanna and one or two other people from the Wilcox Center. I think Arlene Thurston must have been there too. And I think we had like just woke up and we were going down to have breakfast. For some reason Linda and me and one other girl were sitting on a towel eating in front of the TV. And Linda was bugging me and bugging me and bugging me and bugging me and bugging me and bugging me, like she does, about letting her go into my studio and make a copy of a CD. And she wanted a copy of like Asa Base  and now that I think of it, I don’t know why the heck she would want that one because she doesn’t like that kind of stuff. But in my dream that’s what she wanted a copy of. And I was thinking of how, when Mom gets breakfast on and everyone’s eating breakfast, I’ll just run up there, make a copy real fast and bring it down and give to Linda so she’ll have it and I won’t have to have her mess through all my stuff and everything. And then when I got in there and I was sitting down to make the copy, I realized that I didn’t have an original, and therefore the STMS was going to scream and yell in my face, and so I had to put in my personal CD player and do an analog. And that’s when I kind of woke up. "
769,"I dreamed that I owned this ""salty bar"" with Granddaddy right next to the ocean. One day, the whole school had to sail over to China to hear some sort of lecture. I missed the boat and had to swim over. I had brought a plate of Brie, but it was filled with poisonous crabs from my trip over. I dropped the dish when I got on land, and was terrified that they would poison me. But then I told myself that this was a dream, so I kept on walking to the lecture. When I got there, it was more like SNL than a serious lecture. I couldn't understand why we'd had to travel that whole way for this. I was sitting on the stage and could see Jackson right in front of me. The lecture ended  hours early. The deans said we had to remain there for the next  hours before going back. Vanessa started whining but then everyone made fun of her, so that was OK. Then Jackson looked at me and said he loved me and I woke up."
770,"I first dreamed that my dean and I were best friends and I always went to his house to hang out. It was weird. Then I dreamed that Charla and I were in New Hampshire at Granddaddy's, and she wanted to take a boat on the lake at night. I knew it was a bad idea, but I went out with her anyway. We were  feet out into the water when I decided to turn back, because I knew this was wrong. My father had been sitting on the dock the whole time, and was proud that I had turned back. Then I dreamed that Sue and I were doing track. We finished with our warm up and this guy came up to talk to me. He was cute, sort of looked like Dylan and Nicholas put together. We were talking and flirting, and then all of a sudden, we were back at my house. He was flirting with me while we watched a movie. His name was Kevin Laradin, which is a name I've never heard or read before. Then I woke up."
771,"I dreamed that I had to reorganize the periodic table of elements, according to this really hard and horrible formula. Then I was on a boat in the middle of WWII. Then I woke up."
772," Last night I had a really stupid dream . I kind of guess I know where it came from, but man, was I stretching it or what, when I came up with this one?! Not my conscious, of course, but you know what I mean. Well, I don’t know exactly where to start because this was another one of those rambling saga-like type dreams, but I’ll start at the part that I can remember the best. I dreamt that – I think this is where it starts – I woke up at like : in the morning to go to the bathroom, and I had a dream before, but this is the only part I can remember now. Okay, I dreamt that I was in this portable classroom. I didn’t know if I was at my college or my tech school, but I was at one of them, and I was in a portable and the lights were off. And there was carpet on the floor and there were like traditional student desks. And we were going to have a presentation by Bill Putnam, who’s the sound engineer, great. He’s left us now, but in my dream he was still alive and he was going to come give a lecture. And for some reason I had this, it was listed in like a program that he was going to give a concert on a Hammond  organ, and so he came in the room, he talked to us a little, he greeted us, he was like in his ’s. He was kind of in his ’s or ’s and he kind of barely knew what he was doing. And he was talking to us, and before I knew it, he was doing this mime of like trying to show that there was these rotten eggs and how they were smelling, and there were these teddy bears, these teddy bear heads on a stick that somebody was swirling around above the supposedly rotten eggs. And there was like a little _________ things. He was doing this whole mime, and, of course, I wasn’t getting much out of it because I couldn’t see what the heck he was doing. And about three desks over, to my right, kind of in the front of the room, there was this guy, kind of like a side man with a keyboard, that was supposed to play chords and all that were going on behind the mime to kind of give it some music. And this guy was bad, to say the least! He was, I don’t know, it just sounded really, really bad and he didn’t know what he was doing either. He was just kind of like banging around, and it didn’t go with anything that was going on. And then, I don’t know what happened, but the scene just sort of like suddenly switched, and we were supposed to go on a boat trip at night. I keep having dreams that Dad and us and the family are supposed to go on this boat. And so I dreamt that we were going on a boat trip, and I don’t remember where we were going, but I know we were going to go at night. Oh, I remember – this is kind of crazy, man. I don’t know where this came from, but apparently, I think I kind of visualized this when we were out on our walks and this is where it came from, but I was supposed to be on the boat and sing and give a concert to some thousands of people who were along the shoreline and on docks and at the Coachman and the Wayne Point Park and stuff. And apparently not only was I supposed to sing, but I was supposed to play too, and I had an instrument for me there on the boat, or at least I thought they were going to have one there for me. It’s one of those things where you think it’s going to be there, but you never see it, I guess because, I don’t know, but anyway, it was supposed to be there, and it was supposed to be there, supposed to be there. And I get on this boat and it’s there, and we were getting settled and stuff and we’re ready to take off, and I’m ready to stand up there and sing to the people out there, and the instrument starts shrinking and shrinking and shrinking and shrinking and shrinking. And next thing I know it’s the size of like something for a Barbie doll. And the captain of the boat told me that I should take it home and put it in the bird cage for Archie , that he would want it and that he could benefit from it because he could learn some notes to sing. And like that’s bizarre, man. And I think that is when I woke up. Man, man, man – as _______ would say. I think I can start maybe unraveling where this dream may have come from. First of all, the Bill Putnam thing came from me reading the studio book, of course, but why he would come in and do a mime about rotten eggs? Don’t ask me! But it’s becoming more obvious to me where the singing and playing on a boat would have come from. Astrid has been making up stories about Phil Collins sailing through the Straits of Silla and Corybdus, and playing Silla’s favorite piece on the keyboard, which is, I think it is, I don’t know, it’s called “Farralene” , it goes  and a couple others, the theme of the Titanic and different things like that. And I guess seeing the boat parade, hearing her stories about that, and being down at the waterfront and visualizing a floating stage and everybody on land watching a performance out there. All that came together and made this bizarre dream. Now the shrinking, I think might be something to the effect that it seems so close, but it’s not. And, if you know what I mean, and I don’t know, just something goofy that came out of that, I guess."
773," Last night I had a dream. I know there was more to it, but this is all I can remember so far. First of all, information: sometimes when the chickens get elderly, they get kind of in poor condition, and some age better than others, I guess, just like people. But in my dream there was this white chicken and Dad wanted to wash her off on her back side because she was really getting messy. And so he was going to, he wanted to see if I could hang onto the chicken for him, and he was thinking of putting her in one of the like a harness thing, like you would a dog. And I said, “I don’t think so, Tim. I will hold the chicken with my arms and keep her from getting away.” And so, sitting on the picnic table with the chicken, she’s white, but she kind of has the build and weight of a Rhode Island Red, and they’re kind of hard to contain because we only have one left, and she’s a red Rhode Island Red, but for some reason in my dream, she was white. And I’m holding the chicken and he’s dilly dally, dilly dally, dilly dally, dilly dallying around, and I can’t figure out why. And then I say that I need to, I realize that it’s : in the afternoon and I haven’t had lunch, so and the chicken looks hungry too, believe it or not. So I tell him that he should hold the chicken for a minute so that I can go get some seeds. I went inside and got a bite of my plate and I was kind of disappointed because I was smelling fried food in the chicken, but what I got was only a baloney sandwich. Then I came back out with some seed for the chicken, and I guess that kept her busy for a few minutes, and then we continued the operation. And he was telling me how bad she was looking, how it looked like she had a ton of bacteria and stuff because one time one of our chickens was like in bad shape. And then I think we were done and I let the chicken go. And there was this truck that was going by that had sirens on it and back-up alarms going forward, and I like fell to the ground and rolled over and laid there until it passed. And I can’t remember anything more."
774,"I dreamed that Sue and I were planning to go out to dinner with  boys as our dates. My brother was organizing times and places. Sue was taking Lou, and I was going with a blind date. I walked into my room and Sophia was painting my walls this horrible color. Then I woke up."
775,I dreamed that my brother and I were buying my father a present. We were on this whitewater rafting trip and my brother and I kept laughing at him because he was playing the piano really badly. Then I woke up.
776," Last night I had a dream that we were up in the territory of my tech school and I only had like two or three days, maybe even two or three hours before I started classes there. And we were like outside in like a park area, and I had to go into the building to use the bathroom, and I needed to ask the counselor and the secretary for a calendar of like time off and stuff like that. And so I went in this like real just blah building and it was like the lady who came out wouldn’t let me go any further until I showed her my ID and I could prove that I was going to be a student in a few days. And I dreamt that there was this man counselor that I knew that she directed me towards that I had a feeling that I had had a real technical discussion with before, and that I felt real comfortable with. And he wanted to know if I had decided what kind of mixer board was best for me, and I told him I hadn’t yet. And I got the calendar and I went back outside and then I woke up."
777,"I dreamed that Sue and I were going to some party and it was really exciting because Lou was going to be there. But all the awful girls weren't. So it was a really big deal for some reason. I had this long discussion about it with my parents. I showered before I went out, but I hit my head on the faucet. I fell over and couldn't go and was really upset. Then I woke up."
778," I don’t know if this is all going to fit, but I’m going to try. Last night I had a dream that I was at this theme park, and I can remember bits and pieces of it. Bad me – I let it drag on until it’s : o’clock in the afternoon now, but I didn’t have time to record it this morning when I first woke up. So I dreamt that I was at a theme park with Elizabeth, and it was kind of a school field trip like type thing. And there was this ride called the Kumba Roller Coaster – it was either the Kumba or the Montu – it was kind of like Tyme Gardens. And we’d go on this roller coaster and we’d roller coaster around. It would be an “Ahhhhhhhhhh!” thrill ride. There was also this ride that I liked that was a slide that would like spray you with water as you were sliding down this big, tall slide, and you’d hear these really cool sounds as you were going by, like it had a really neat sound system, which that and spraying water just don’t go together, but maybe they did. I think I heard something like that at some kind of theme park, and that’s where I got the idea from. And once you got down to the bottom of this big slide, you’d fall into this swimming pool that was really deep and you swam to the other end, and that was okay. And we only had a little bit of time left, but I wanted Elizabeth to go on this slide with me, and she said, “No, no, I’m too chicken; you have to go by yourself.” And so I went, but it was kind of funny because the slide wouldn’t spray me with the water and there was no sound. All that it was, was that you could slide down the slide and that was it. And I imagined in my dream that this slide was pink and that the pool was pink, instead of blue like they usually are. And so, sorry folks, the tape is coming to an end. I will start over on the next one. Alright, I don’t expect this tape to last me more than about a month’s worth of material, maybe even less, but it’s just a junky marketing tape anyway, and it’s no good for anything else, and this is better than having it thrown in the garbage. So, let us begin! I am going to start over and repeat a dream that I wasn’t able to fit on the last tape. It is now close to : o’clock at night and I am kind of fortunate that even part of it has stayed with me this long because I just didn’t have the time to do it this morning. So anyway, I dreamt that I was at this amusement park, and I was there with Elizabeth, and it was kind of like Tyme Gardens, except in my dream it didn’t really have a name. And we were like on this school field trip and her and I were kind of running around together, and I think everybody else kind of just ditched us. And we were like running around going on these rides. There was this huge, open park picnic area in the middle of the park that kind of reminded me of my college Quad, except that it had picnic tables and stuff and like amusement park type fencing and white-colored tables. And there was this one ride that was like the Mod II or the Kumba, and it was just a roller coaster. You would have to walk up very high to get to it though, like a boardwalk; you’d have to climb stairs and go up ramps and snakes and winds, kind of like you have to do when you’re at a theme park, except this was all in the open and on a like a wooden boardwalk. And I wanted to get Elizabeth to go on that, and I think maybe we did, but I have no memory of actually being on a ride. Then there was this other ride that I really, really liked supposedly, and it was supposedly a pink slide that you would slide down and it would spray you with water from the side, and you’d hear these really cool sounds as you’d be going by. Now spraying water and a cool sound system don’t exactly go together, but, you know, in theme parks sometimes they may have everything all water-tight. And I was trying to get Elizabeth to go down this slide with me because we only had a little bit of time left and I wanted to make us do this before we had to go. And the slide was pink and I went down it; she was too chicken. And it didn’t spray and the water and it didn’t make the sounds. It was just like a slide, because I think the park was like going to close, but I didn’t feel like it was. And then I like landed in this pool of water, like you would expect at most theme park rides, slide things, and when I first landed in it, the pool had a pink bottom instead of a blue bottom like they usually do. And then as I was swimming behind this other girl, and I became aware that I was swimming over like a grate venting and my feet were about to touch the bottom, then the pool turned blue like they usually are. And you know how in dreams when you dream about swimming, or at least I do, the water like tosses you around and you like, you sink to the bottom as though gravity were holding you down, but you can still breathe by some miracle? This is how I always dream when I dream about swimming in a pool. I don’t know why. Usually the water wants to pull me up because I’m a female and I have the female fat buoyancy thing. Dad just sinks like a rock. But anyway, I have to really fight to get down and stay down if I want to dive under water, but in my dream I just sort of sink and I can still breathe. But anyway, enough of that. And so, I don’t know how I got myself like all dried off and everything in such a hurry, but we went back to this like classroom that was at the theme park and there was a TV, they were going to show a movie. And I was kind of thinking, “I want to sit where I can see the movie,” because I thought it was going to be halfway interesting, but Elizabeth said, “Nah, nah, let’s sit over here in this section where we can goof around and nobody will see us!” And it was close to one of those like candy machines that they have at my college. And before anything else could happen, I woke up."
779,"I dreamed that I fell asleep right next to Lou, but that I woke up next to Jackson! I actually woke up alone."
780,"I dreamed that I had to write an essay in Spanish about the most embarrassing thing to ever happen to me. I remember saying to myself ""Tengo que escribir un ensayo sobre un dia cuando soy..."" But I couldn't remember the word for embarrassment. Then it hit me --verguenza! And I woke myself up muttering ""verguenza"" in real life. Weird."
781," Last night I guess you could say I had kind of a typical dream, something you would expect from somebody who has a class that they’re going to the next day. I was dreaming that I was up at the right time and all and waiting for the cab, but instead of the cab coming for me, Elizabeth and Chelsea showed up at the door, and Mom and I got in their van thing, and we were riding along and Elizabeth and Chelsea decided to take us to Mr. Denton’s house. Mr. Denton was my economics teaching in my senior year that, I don’t know, he thought I was the greatest thing since sliced bread, but all his kids were really kind of “blah” anyway, and so was his class. And so he thought I was just so intelligent and so wonderful, but anyway, we went to Mr. Denton’s house and they took a bunch of pictures. And he still had his Christmas things up. And we, I was looking at his little village scene set up things and they were really cool. And then we went to the beach, of all places. And we bummed around at the beach, and we were talking about various different things, I can’t remember what. And then finally they decided that they were going to take me back to class, and I got there in time for Speech class, but I had totally skipped Ethics class. And I was trying to persuade Mom not to show the pictures from Mr. Denton’s class to Dad because he would know that I skipped Ethics class. And I think Mom and Elizabeth and Chelsea were going to go somewhere and they were going to come back for me for lunch, but I woke up before any of that happened. Oh, and I dreamt that I was real afraid because the cab people were going to say I was a no-show, so they’d automatically cancel the return trip, and so Mom and Elizabeth and Chelsea were going to come and get me and we were going to go have some more fun after my class. And then I woke up."
782,I dreamed I was Julia Stiles.
783," Last night I had a messed up dream, man! It was just so kind of whacked out. I don’t know where it came from really, but then maybe I do. I dreamt that I finally got the gift that I had been wanting for some time. And, you know, I’ve been having these dreams. So I finally had it, and it was finally in my closet and I was so proud. And Dad was going to help me set it up in my sound studio, but first I had to learn how to flush the toilet without making it clog up. And the trick of it was you had to hold down the handle until just after the stuff had made it down, and then let it go immediately after that. And if you didn’t let it go, or you let it go too soon, the whole thing would be for naught, which for real life, in both of our toilets, we have to hold it down, but it’s not the end of the world if we let it go too soon. So a couple, I tried it like three times, but it didn’t really work right, and we had this big Jacuzzi like tub in the upstairs bathroom and Dad had to take a dream clog stopper out of the tub to kind of let some more air into the pipes, I guess. That was crazy. And, oh my gosh, there was a big flash of lightning outside. But anyway, I can’t remember what happened after that, but somebody was going on a plane somewhere. I think it wasn’t going to be Mom and I going up to my relative’s home town. I think it was going to be Dad and Mom going somewhere, and I was finally going to get to investigate my gift. And I woke up before any of that could happen and realized it was a dream. If I keep having all these stupid dreams, I’m not going to know the real thing if it does happen. "
784,"I had the worst dream ever. I dreamed that I was at some sort of camp, but it was military/boot camp. We were running laps around the track until I thought I was going to be sick. Then I got news that both my mother and father had died. I freaked out. But the guy kept making me run more laps. So then I threw up and I told myself that this had to be a dream. But I couldn't wake myself up. So then we had to sail down this river. But my boat got lost and I had to swim against the current. Thank god I woke up."
785,"Last night I dreamed that I was in the dining hall and Mrs. Frank was yelling at me because I didn't like babysitting her sons. I felt bad, but I had to leave to go to class."
786," Last night I had kind of a crazy dream. First of all, I think the first, I had a lot of elements that were real fragmented, now when I think about it. But I think I laid through a lot of stage one, just kind of half conscious awareness from : to : this morning, so that’s how it got all fragmented. But some elements that I can remember first is that my application into my tech school I was pretty sure was going to be rejected for some reason, and I had kind of resigned myself to the thought that I just can’t be in the sound business because my vision prevents me from doing some, perceiving and acting socially, and I think I move around too slowly on some of the programs and there’s no way in the world that I can operate these big huge mixer boards. Now this is all what I’m thinking in my dream, as I’m standing in this yellow room with big boards all over everywhere, almost like our kitchen is now, except it was huge like a warehouse. And I was just standing there thinking, and I had the feeling like there were like tons of people around me, but nobody was saying anything, I didn’t hear anything. I was just thinking all of this.  Ummmm, a big blob of snot! Anyway, now that that’s out of the way, then the next scene that I can remember is that I was at home. It was like the night before I had classes, like last night was, and I was sick with some kind of cold or flu or something, and I was laying on the couch with Mom and we were kind of almost asleep. And I was singing to her. And I had some kind of thing where I still couldn’t go to sleep and I had to get up and take some kind of medicine, so she got up with me. And we went in the kitchen, which was kind of normal, the way it used to be, and she had me take a few pills by drinking down some water and taking them. And then she gave me applesauce that had like peanuts chopped up in it, and I think I ate it and it was good, and as I was eating it, I woke up. That was kind of crazy, but I think this is a very telling dream that brings out some of the inhibitions that I have and this subconscious fear that I have, that no matter how hard I try, I’m not going to be capable in this field. And even if I were to realize that, I would be just devastated, and I’d probably be like a societal hermit for the rest of my life. At this point I don’t know what else to do with my life. I know that’s bad, but it is, it’s true. And I guess I’ve been thinking a lot about going away. I’ve already started a little box of stuff, and I practiced filling out a practice application on last year’s, in last year’s catalog, and it slipped down behind my bed. And I figured, “Oh heck, it’s just last year’s scrap copy anyway; it doesn’t matter.” And I even had a duplicate in my catalog, but I think that might have had something to do with it."
787,"I dreamed that we had a holiday, so everyone was in the main building. It was really boring, however, and no one was doing anything. Everyone, including the boys, was wearing pants and a bra. It was weird. So then Kim and Sue went to Sue's house. I remember seeing Kevin and Nicholas and Hannah in Bundy. A girl on the first floor was trying to go to sleep and told me to go to bed too. But I couldn't think about sleep. But then when I concentrated really hard, it sort of worked. Then I was talking online and Sue and Kim were soaked because it was raining. I was asking Aidan if I could sleep in his room, since I couldn't here. He laughed and said yes. Then I woke up."
788," Last night I dreamt that Astrid and me were at my college together, and we were in this office waiting to see our degree program advisor, and I had the feeling it was supposed to be, I was already seeking an audio degree at my college. And I can’t remember the exact title, but I remember thinking in my dream back to an experience that I felt kind of inferior, when we were in a class, kind of it looks like kind of at my tech school with a huge mixer board, and there was this one guy who was doing most of the work in the hands-on learning. And the other five or six of us – there were like ten others of us – and we were just standing there watching. And I figured, “How am I ever going to learn if I keep going at this rate?” And so I was thinking about that when we were sitting in this office. You know how they have the U line, the queue thing? Well, it was dark and they were playing a movie for us while we were waiting because we had to wait like forever and a day. And then I think I had a memory that I was going to ask Uncle Richard if he could lend me his copy of “A New Day Has Come” because it was in surround sound, and I was just dying to hear the thing mixed in surround sound, which in real life the truth of the matter is that I saw it in a collection of others in Sound and Vision. And whenever I listen to it, I think, “Man, would this be great mixed in surround sound!” And so I was going to borrow it from him and play it on his sound system, since he had a SA CD player, and I think when we were standing in that office waiting for that guy, I was like crying about something, I don’t know what! And we were supposed to like, I don’t even know what we were going to say. I didn’t even know if we were going to see a man advisor or a woman, but it kind of reminded me of Ms. Maggot from Stephen King’s memoir, and I think I was going to see somebody like her. And so then I dreamt that I was at Uncle Larry’s house – how I shifted to that scene, I don’t know. But instead of being at Uncle Richard’s, I was at Uncle Larry’s house and I was going to play “A New Day Has Come” in surround sound, but somehow I woke up before I could do that. That was kind of dumb, wasn’t it?"
789,"I dreamed that I was taking a shower in the bathroom, but it was in the main building. I was fully clothed, though, so I just walked out of the shower. Vanessa came by and hip-checked me out of the way. I was really nice to her though, even though she is a bitch. Then I was in chemistry class and we were trying to make shampoo and they had to test it out on me. It was horrible. Then I saw Jackson and woke up."
790,. My dad I are hanging out with a football player that just had surgery. My mom kept looking for dresses at the mall. Robert got hit in the balls. Coach Temple hugged me. My cousin Nancy and they were there. We all went to the spin thing in the mall.
791," Last night I had kind of a crazy dream, that I was taking this music class on Saturdays from : to : at my college, and it was kind of put that way loosely because we could go whenever we wanted. And it was supposed to be so that it could be getting credit without actually interfering with the rest of my schedule. And so I went there and it was given by this man, this kind of older man, on this huge front porch of this building. It was almost like a stage that this class was given on. And there were like five or six people who were in a van and the rest of us who were just kind of like there. And I guess we were going to take turns being in the van or something. But he was telling us how when one person leads you have to follow them, and if they decide to do one thing or another, it’s kind of disrespectful to ask them about it. It’s really just the opposite. And so I think we did the Bruce Hornsby song that I’ve been listening to, I think that’s just the way it is. And I wanted to talk to the guy, but the guy thought that I was coming over to criticize him, and he ran. And then I dreamt that my place where I was studying ethics was like up high on a cliff, and I was going to find a better place, but it was so hot. And I dreamt that Allison was involved in all this because she was kind of the music teacher’s assistant, and they were holding this seminar on a Saturday, and they weren’t sure who was coming. And I said I was coming, but I didn’t know about anybody else. And that’s pretty much it, I think."
792,". Nick L. was my brother-in-law. I was at a big house, taking care of a baby, and then Nicole was there."
793," Last night I had two dreams. First I dreamt that I was up half the night just kind of goofing around and I was so upset because I couldn’t get to sleep. And then I really woke up and I knew that I had gotten some sleep. And then I went back to sleep and had a dream about my tech school. I dreamt that, first of all – this is the crazy part – I think I’ve been watching too much TV – there were these four or five people in my room that were kind of talking to us and all, and there was this one boy who wanted to see my DP program because he wanted to learn to mix too. And I said I’m going to come back and show it to him, and I went and told Mom. These four girls were the ones they weren’t sure about. Apparently I had the notion they had been discovered in a room that had a meth lab underneath it. Oh, my gosh, I don’t know what’s up for that. "
794," But after that scene I was at my tech school, which really I started off being at my college and I sort of found myself there at my tech school, and it was a real maze. I came in with Mom and Dad, sort of like at the top of a little hallway, and down to one side was an auditorium, a big auditorium, where you know how the seats go, they went down. And to the other side was steps down into the lobby of the building, and all of this was real colorful like their brochures are. It was like in that brown and black and orange mainly, like their brochure pictures are. And to the left there was lots of little treats and stuff that they set out for people coming in, like little glasses with jello and stuff, and little dessert dishes and ice cream and brownies and stuff. And to the right was lots of stuff, lots of other facilities. And Mom and Dad kind of trailed behind me and let me run along ahead, and it was like a real maze. By the way, I didn’t taste any of the treats; I don’t know why. And I went around to this other stairwell that led back up, and I wanted to see what was up there because I – oh, before that – this is kind of crazy. For some reason I had this set of cans that I picked up from the floor, and when I got to the bottom of the stairwell I turned around and there was these people standing by this little six-channel mixer up on the wall, they were controlling the sound system of the house. And I gave the set to them, and they said, “Oh thanks, they belong here.” And then I turned around and I went up this other stairwell and Mom and Dad were like behind me, but they were a few feet behind me. And I met up with this other, I had the notion like he was a sound engineer, but he was kind of giving us a tour, and he took me up this stairwell that turned into like a ladder to his little recording booth. And there was this opening that was like really, really small, and he said, “Nobody can get in here like this.” He gave me his, like a ticket thing. I slid it in the slot and the whole ladder moved down and the whole thing opened up so that it was then the opening was about from my chest to my head, so then a person could crawl in. But the recording booth was still so small. I don’t know how anybody could sit in there and work comfortably. And I was feeling really claustrophobic at this point because not only was I going to have to go in the small recording booth, but I was going to have to go in the, it was just real tight all around. And then he took us down and outside, and kind of around the back of the building, and we were like in a straw barn and we were sitting on benches kind of outside the straw barn, with hay all around and stuff. And there was a reinforcement system out there in the straw barn, and some guy turned it on and walked away. And for some reason I was so bold, I went up and I sat down at the mixer bench area, and the mixer board was green, kind of like an integrated circuit board, but it had all the stuff right on it, and it was flat. I found the two left and right CD faders and I brought them up, and I tweaked some EQ and stuff, and I was watching the videos  and finally I brought up my master a little. And I went back to my seat and then I woke up. "
795," Last night I dreamt that Dad was in my studio surfing the internet on my machine for some reason, looking for gosh only knows what. And he was on the phone talking to somebody and I thought that he might have brought up one of my journal entries from my folder full of stuff, and so I just kind of said, “Dad, I’m sorry, but this is time and you have to move, you have to let me close this out.” I closed it out and underneath it was the website that he had been looking at, and next thing I knew, I was sitting down in the chair and he was on the phone talking to some relatives. It was like I was listening in on a conversation almost. And I wasn’t really on a website for any purpose; I was just exploring it. And apparently it was like a, you know the front of a Christmas cherub’s  box that was real kind of crazy colors? That’s what the theme of the website was for some reason. And I was kind of thinking, “Okay, I can do a search on the internet for anything I want.” And shortly after that I woke up."
796,I dreamed that Sue and I were going on a backpacking trip.
797," Last night I dreamt that I was at like a fair thing with Mom. I can’t remember if Dad was there or not, and I think that Janice and Larry were in this somewhere. Oh, and I think Allison was there. Mom and me and Allison were walking into this little park thing. It was kind of like a scaled-down Tyme Gardens, and we walked in this path of flowers and little animals in cages and stuff, and then at a certain fork in the path, there was this sign that Mom read to me and it said, “Piggy Zoo Zoo.” And it was kind of funny. Mom said that we’re going to have to go into this auditorium, and we went in and we were seeing this like play. And Mom met up with Dad and Janice and Larry, and Allison kind of disappeared. And they went and sat in the seats in this play, and I stayed behind and I sat at a table in the back of the theater facing the wall, meaning that my left shoulder was facing the stage and my right was facing the door. And I was in this little entrance way hallway and I was facing a wall to the right. And I was doing homework, and I was listening to them doing their play while I was doing my homework. And for whatever reason, I had this tape machine. I think I was listening to like notes I took from class, like if I had recorded a lecture, and I was like listening to that intermittently, and get this – the main actor onstage came off the stage, came all the way back to where I was and said, “Excuse me, Ma’m, but you cannot be taping this for any reason at all, any reason.” And so I was really embarrassed and I shoved it in my bag, even though I wasn’t recording, but then I can’t remember a whole lot after that. I think we were listening to this play some more, and then we went out and then we came back to like a hotel room. And Dad was there and we were talking about something, I don’t remember what. And then I woke up."
798,. Dad was helping me rearrange my room.
799,". Well, I was at the mall and saw Laura and Sarah; that’s just one part. Then we went to this one place kind of like a zoo. We stayed out too late and like the only way you could escape was by climbing up a tree, but like not everyone could climb it  and it was morning and we were still someplace. Then this kid started egging me, so I go, “I am going to kick your ass if you don’t stop,” and then I did. We were escaping and then the twins Mike and Dan were there. And I was all flirting with Mike. And I go, “Can I hug you?” And he said, “Sure, if it is all right with Dan,” who said, “Sure, I don’t care.” Then I hugged Mike and then woke up."
800," Last night I had a dream. I dreamt that, first of all, we had our PC over on the desk in the foyer like we have, that kind of squarish desk. Then for some reason on the roll-top desk we had a Mac in addition to mine upstairs. Now I think that was because somebody who went to the school system regularly needed to print out grades, and they had to print out grades on this special perforated paper that would only print in that kind of a printer. And so in my dream I had a solution to my writing dilemma. I would compose my stories up here, then take then down there on a CD and print them there because the printer would take perforated paper or regular paper. And the roll-top desk in my dream was like a huge, grand and stately thing. And, you know, I don’t remember a whole lot else. Let’s see, you know, it’s a bummer. I don’t remember anything else that happened, but what I can say is that I did a lot of typing for an ethics report yesterday and reading, Mom did a bunch of reading and I had the system on while I was doing a lot of this. And when I would look up to kind of rest my eyes, I would see, I would be looking at the desk from like right up next to it, and so it would look really huge. You know, all the shelves that are up there; that’s what I’m talking about."
801,". My friend Cindy and I kept switching classes, and something else but I don’t remember."
802," Last night I had two dreams, but it’s such a bummer – I can only remember one of them – because I know the second one was good. I remember saying to myself, “This is good, I have to remember it.” And then shortly thereafter, I forgot it. But anyway, I woke up at : in the morning last night and had to go to the bathroom, and I was thinking about my dream while I was sitting on the pot. And then I was only like half conscious the whole time. And then when I went back to bed and I was laying down, I was almost asleep, I reviewed my dream several times in my mind and said, “I have to record this when I’m more alert and awake. Believe it or not, it stayed with me most of the day. Okay, last night I dreamt that I was going with Dad to this big expansive, empty parking lot to take the Peavey system and practice my speech. And he said, “Okay, we’re going to leave in a few minutes,” and I realized I didn’t have my personal CD player or any of the other accessories that I need for here to give my speech. And so I figured it would be better to delay things and make them wait a little than to get there and be totally unprepared. So I took a paper bag and I dropped in my personal CD player, the mini disk recorder, some cables, my wireless mike receiver and the wireless mike itself. And then I was thinking, “Okay, I’m ready to run out the door.” And then I realized I don’t have the XLR cable to connect the receiver to the board. The wireless mike receiver connects to the board with an XLR, and I realized I didn’t have that so I had to dig it out of my drawer. And also I realized I had to dig out the transformer that powers the wireless mike receiver. I had to look in a few places and finally I found it and I threw all that in a bag and I was running out the door, and then I realized it was dark out. I had taken most of the day to get this stuff ready. And each time I would put something in the bag, I would turn and run out the door and, I mean, out of my door and halfway down the stairs and realized that I had forgotten one more thing. And I’d come back and I’d put it in and I’d run down half the stairs, and then I was, “Oh, I forgot one more thing.” And by the time I was all done with it, it was dark, and we just decided that we would go tomorrow. And then I woke up. "
803,. My friend Cindy and I kept switching classes and then there was a fire.
804,"I went to bed at about :. I feel asleep on my left side. Normally I only have sleep paralysis when I am on my back, this is the FIRST time I ever had it while sleeping on my side. I immediately feel into an SP state . My breathing was extremely labored as usual. I felt vibrations throughout my body and focused on leaving my body so I wouldn't be stuck in this state. Suddenly I was out, felt like I was floating but couldn't see a thing. Finally I was able to see a bit. I didn't have much control over where I was going. I kinda floated down to what looked like my bed. I could see the bedspread, and like last time, it was alive and moving. The patterns on the bedspread were basically moving all around. Then I float over to the wall and look at it. I see the normal white wall, but then these  white patterns started coming out of it. It looked really cool. Reminded me of visuals you would see on mushrooms. I figured if I turned around I would see the window, so I started to turn and I see the blinds. I head for them and passed right through the blinds and down to the street below in front of Ralphs. I remember seeing someone there but then things got hazy. At this point I am back in my bed but still in an SP state. I wake up slightly and then realize I had woken up, but then suddenly I was back I saw myself floating down to the floor, this time I didn't wanna be there, I wanted to wake up. This can be extremely difficult. So I deliberately started making noise, kinda like grunting. And I did it load enough where I was able to wake myself. At which point I had to sit up in order to become fully awake and not fall back into that state again. I'm not sure why I freaked out the  time around and wanted to wake up, I think I was just really tired and just wanted some sound sleep. The whole episode lasted about  minutes, when I looked at the clock it was :. "
805,". James and my friend Cindy’s boyfriend came over and we hung out. Dad was like, “I don’t care if they hang out; they just have to keep the door open all the way.” So we just curled up on the couch and watched a movie. I was sitting on the couch drinking energy drinks, then Molly and my dad got lost, then I found my dad and said, “You just have to find love,” and then walked off."
806,. We kept going in the gym in the morning and stuff. It was stupid.
807,"I dreamed first that I was in this huge mansion and I had to help deliver all these babies. All the women having the babies had to go up all these stairs though. Then I had to help them down the stairs to the delivery room. So then I was a slave in some huge landowner's house and I was running away with a baby in my little green Oshkosh overalls from when I was a baby. So we stole this food and other things we would need and put them in Bloomingdales bags. As soon as we left the house, the woman came after as, so we hid under a bench. I prayed she wouldn't see us or hear us breathing. The next dream I had --I was in the library trying to steal something heavily guarded by giant squids. It was impossible and I was really frustrated. The library was like a planetarium, so I lay down and looked up at all the stars in the ceiling. Then I had to go to Spanish class. Then I woke up."
808," Last night I had a very active and interesting dream. I dreamt that Sheryl, Sandra and Sam and Lee and Nikki and probably Jason were all in town again and they were all in our house. And it was like they had all flown in and I think Sheryl and Sandra and I were visiting, and I think we took a walk around the park and everybody but Sheryl ran ahead, and Mom and Dad and I and Sheryl were on this walk, and I was – see, this is a dream within a dream again. I dreamt that I had this dream that Dan O’Brien had given me like a miniature guitar thing as a souvenir from his show; not a real one, but, you know, like a, I guess like a little refrigerator magnet, hang it on your mirror type of thing. It was like on the end of a graduation tassel. And I dreamt that I was telling all this to Dad and Mom and Sheryl. And Dad was like, “Now, what would be the point of that?” And we couldn’t convince him because it was a lack of facts. And now that I think of it, I don’t think that would be something that he would really think bad about, but in my dream he did. He was going on about, “What would be the point of that?” And why in the world would somebody do something like that? But then again, in real life he’s always doing insane things that I’d never guess he would, so I guess that’s where that would come from. And then suddenly the scene shifted and we were at home, and it was like bedtime because it was like : or : at night, and, you know, we think it’s bedtime, but they go on hours into the night. So this is the crazy part! Sheryl and Sandra and Sam and me and Nikki were all going to sleep in the same bedroom downstairs, the master bedroom, with Mom and Dad. They were all going to sleep in the same room! And I was going to be up here all nice and peaceful and quiet and everything. And for whatever reason, I took out the mermaid doll and I shoved it under my pillow for some reason, and I was getting adjusted and I heard them all jumping up and down and screaming, laughing, having a good time. So I figure, “Okay, I’m missing something, so I’ll go down there and check it out.” And Sheryl and Sandra and the guys were kind of wrestling. I don’t know where Mom and Dad were, but then I realized that I was totally naked and was probably embarrassing everybody but Sheryl and Sandra, and I said, “Oh, fashion, fashion,” and they covered kind of my chest. And Sandra took each of my hands in hers and spread them all wide and kind of showed me to them, and was like, “Yeah, fashion!” And that was okay because, of course, it was Sandra. And so then I came back up here again and Sandra and I kind of talked about what, I do not know. And then I was resting again, and then I could overhear Mom was in her workroom and Sheryl was in there talking about how bummed I was because of what Dad said about my dream thing. Oh, and Sam and Louise came up here because they wanted to listen to some news in the bedroom, and it didn’t work, so they asked if they could turn on mine and I saw, “Sure.” So I moved over to the left side of the bed here and I let them sit down on the right side, and I think Nikki was there too. And my radio turned into a TV and they were watching TV and they were watching TV, and I figured, “Alright, I’m going on the couch.” So I went on the couch, and that’s all I can remember, and then I woke up."
809,"I first dreamed that I was in the chapel, which was huge. Lou was next to me and I remember hearing the organ music from above. All of a sudden, I was in my bedroom. My friends and I were flying mattresses outside my window. There was tundra and icy cold water beneath us, so we didn't want to fall in. First it was just Sue and I, so it was easy to balance. Then more of our friends wanted to join us, but we weren't sure if the mattress could hold all of us. So Sue took a rope and attached it to the mattress and swam through the air. We were all fine. Then I realized that we didn't have our wings, and we all started falling. We landed hard in some military school. We ran away. So then I was at school in the snack bar. I ordered a blueberry muffin and ate it outside. I saw Caleb reading something and he called me over to lie down with him. I lay down and he put his book down. He wrapped his arm around me and held my hand with his free hand underneath his chin. He blinked and I could feel his eyelashes on my forehead. Our lips were touching, but we weren't kissing. I was worried about my breath. He started breathing a little harder and pulled me closer. Then I saw my mother and father, but they didn't see me. And then I woke up."
810,"I dreamed that we were having Martin Luther King Jr. Day in a huge stadium, like Madison Square Garden. One of our all school sessions had just finished, so we were all leaving. I saw Jackson and we did our little smiling thing. I made the sign that I would call him. So then I was doing laundry in the mailroom and I ran out of quarters. I finally found some and put them in the slot. I remember being very confused as to how to do my laundry. Then we had to go back to the auditorium and all watch a movie. It was the freshmen class doing a skit about how much they hated Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Weird...then there was this woman who looked like Mary Poppins. She had a butterfly costume on and was asking this man in the audience to marry her. He said he would do anything but marry her. Then she flew off with the rest of the butterflies. Then someone shot her down. A boy ran to her fallen body and opened up her wings. They were beautiful. I took them and left the auditorium away from everyone else. A little girl ran up behind me and tried to take the wings. They ripped a little bit, but I gave them to her. I was yelled at for this. I went to shower and realized that one of my shoes was gone. I went to the locker room and looked for it. But it wasn't there. So I never found it, but I remember seeing the boys going to soccer practice."
811,". I was at the mall, kept going up to random people and hugging them saying, “Oh, I can’t believe I found you, Dad,” but then like some guy raped me and I blacked out, then some people flew me back to school. Then James, my friend Cindy and I hung out with Janet Jackson."
812,". My cousin Nancy and I wanted to take pictures, like pro pictures, and we needed to get big J to throw up. James kissed me."
813,"Last night I dreamed that I was in the auditorium. Wyatt was mixing some music on different CDs for me. I was really excited! Wyatt gave me the CDs to copy. Then my mother, brother, and I all had to go on some trip. A spider crawled out of my brother's backpack and he threw a huge fit. We all walked into a grocery store to buy snacks. I wanted to get juice boxes in the store and my mother got really upset. She bought my brother chips. Then she remembered that she had left something important at home. So we had to leave. Then I was in the auditorium and it was snowing and everyone was dancing. Then I woke up."
814,"I dreamed that James Bond lived in my basement and was having a huge party. There were  bars, strippers, gamblers, kegs, and lots of music and everything. I went down there and people were playing card games. But the people weren't real. I guess I just asked why the people weren't real. Someone told me that James Bond was impersonal. So the fake people represented the superficiality of them. I went back upstairs. Then I was trying to watch a movie, but my brother and Wyatt were shooting hockey pucks all over the place and I couldn't do whatever it was I wanted to do. I was really frustrated. Granddaddy was making cereal for a present for me."
815," Last night I had kind of a goofy dream that Jack and Patti were in town, and Uncle Jack was listening to my mini disk machine because I was like showing it to him, and there were some audio files on one of the things there that he was listening to. And for some reason I was going on a website that I could look at the results of the Top  countdown, and the songs were listed from like  to  and they had these little icons next to them with pictures that were supposedly the pictures of the CD covers but really had nothing to do with the song. I think that comes from like in Word documents and things, you have a list and you’ve got these big icons and list information, and it’s just all over in your face, which is how I like it. But that’s the way it is. I was doing that, and I kind of left it there because I had a feeling that he was going to want to see it. And then I went out in the front yard where they were, and I discovered that Jack and Patti were then sitting, laying in this like silk tent in our front yard. They had like pillows and blankets and sleeping bags and stuff in it, and they were literally camped out in our front yard. And I couldn’t figure out why, but this is the really crazy part – Jack had these butterfly stickers – not really stickers, but laminated pieces of cardboard with shiny hologram butterflies on them and birds and all kinds of crazy stuff, pictures of bicycles and birds and cars and just stuff, and they were all squares the size of mini disks, and he could slide them into the mini disk player instead of lifting the lid with the latch. He would slide them into to this like a slot, and he had this projector thing in his pants, and he would hold the unit so that the front of it could send an infrared signal to the projector saying it would project it on a screen in my pants! And he was looking at jpeg pictures and seeing these crazy hologram butterflies up on the projector thing, and hearing audio files too, not just through the player, but on a sound system in there and stuff. It was crazy! And then I think I woke up."
816,". James came over and we were watching TV. Then my mom and my dad came crashing through the wall with the car. My mom was like, “Jamie, I need to talk to you.” I was like, “Mom, it wasn’t like we were having sex or anything like that so don’t freak out.”"
817," Okay, last night I had a crazy dream about DBS mainly, which is kind of crazy because I never dream about them. But first in this dream I kind of had the notion that I was riding with Dad in the truck in the middle of the night with my bag of stuff and the Peavey system, and we were going on a long, three-hour trip to do a DJ gig somewhere, but I don’t actually remember doing the gig. I don’t remember coming home, I don’t remember where it was, I just know that I was sort of getting ready. Then Mom and I – I think I do remember getting home from the gig and Mom had to take me to the DBS office to pick up some paper, and they had this big, huge complex, not just a little office in a big building, like they have. And so we walked over there when we got there, and we were just going to pick up the paper and leave, but Carolyn wanted to talk to me. And somebody else did too, so I can’t remember anything about what I said, but I think I said, “Hi, hello,” to Carolyn. And then there was this other person. She was kind of younger than Carolyn, but she was a little more kind of uppity like, just a little. And we were going around, I don’t remember why, but she gave some kind of direction to Mom. They had this like field area out in the back that was for mobility training, and she wanted Mom and I to walk to it. And it was like a street, like a city street, with like just empty fields and nothing on either side. And how that could be anything big for trade, I don’t know. And so we started walking down this road and I realized that there were these – every so often in certain places, there were these like cover things, but they weren’t covered, and half was silver and half was black. And when you would step on them, you would get an electric shock because apparently they wanted to do like conditioning to keep you in the middle of the street. And ever so often there would be one on either side, and if you stepped on it, I guess the silver half was the positive and the black half was the negative. I don’t know, you’d have to be between the two of them, because you know how that goes. I think I had my white cane with me that time, and even when it would, when my tip would touch it, I would feel it through my hand, which I don’t know why because my tip is plastic and the aluminum part is really insulated really well by the rubber top. I don’t know, I guess I just wasn’t thinking when I created this dream. And so we were going along, and at first I didn’t mind, we were walking along and it was kind of pitch dark and we could see where the street was, but sometimes they’d have them in the middle of our path. Then they got to the point where they weren’t just every so often. They were like all over, and they were getting bigger with more voltage on them, so it felt stronger. Mom still didn’t mind them, so then she was carrying me over some of them, and she was getting them all and she was going, “Ooh, ah,” but she didn’t mind them. I was like petrified and she kind of didn’t care. And there was no like turning back around and going back because this path was like a circle; it would lead you back to the building. We got back to the building and we had to go upstairs for some reason because there was a bathroom in there, and they had you take a shower after you’ve been on this trip, if people have any feet yet, if they’re not black yet. But, you know, the really wild part, after we were on that trip I noticed that there were a few here or there inside the building, and so by that time I was like afraid to take any step in any one direction because these things, I didn’t know where the heck they were and when they were going to pop up. And in some cases, when we would be in the hallway, they wouldn’t be there, and sometimes they would just pop up, except in the building they wouldn’t be black and silver; they would blend in with whatever was around. And so I never did take my shower as prescribed, but I had to go up and down the elevator, which wasn’t just for anybody to use. Somebody had to specially activate it for us, so we went down the stairs a few times too, and we noticed how steep the stairs were. So Mom and I had to make a sign that said, “Beware, drops off.” And I was kneeling on one stair and laying on the other, and there was the most awful smell on the stairwell, like gym sweat. And somebody was coming up beside us, and I moved over and left them pass, and I finished my sign and then I stuck it up there. And then we went down the stairs, and then, thank goodness, that fiasco was over. Then my dream continues though, we met up with Dad at the Coliseum and Mom and Dad were conferring outside and I went in and I was giving our information to the person at the desk, like how old am I, how old is the person I’m with, this and that and the other. And it was more like applying for, applying for some kind of government aid just to get into a dance. And the guy said he had a check for me because I had made that long trip and did a Peavey system gig. And so it ended up that I didn’t have to pay to get into the dance, but he paid me for something. And so it turned out, just before I woke up, me and Dad and Mom, we sat outside in the lobby and were eating some kind of lunch before the dance really got started. Now what I don’t understand is when I was on the DBS mobility trail, the ________ mobility trail, I don’t understand why it was totally dark outside and here at the Coliseum it was broad daylight. Oh well, that’s one of the aspects of the dream. The next dream stems from a lot of things, the first thing being that I always have had something inside of me about covers, but they’ve always either just popped up or sprayed water or something. I’ve never had anything electrical going on. I think it’s because now, whenever I handle the Peavey system outside, I’m conscious of it. Even this last time I practiced my speech, I was on the sidewalk and everything was dry, and I was still feeling a little bit of something. So I put on my shoes, and, of course, the fears went away, but still I’m more conscious of that now. And also I don’t know where DBS comes into the picture; I guess because I’m becoming more independent lately and some people just don’t know how independent I can be, not them, but some people I know. And we had to fill out a long, lengthy f___ application so the guy at the Coliseum desk asking me all those question fits in just fine. And he paying me for a Peavey gig is, I guess, because I got several scholarship checks in the mail, and that’s the end of that."
818,". Was at the mall with my mom and my dad, then saw James and ran to him and was like, “Thank god, one of my friends!” and that was it."
819," Last night I had a really messed up dream, man. I dreamt that I was like riding in a cab with somebody and I got out at this like dollar store where I was supposed to meet Mom. And some guy in a tuxedo came and knelt down like to the side of me and grabbed my arm with his hand. And he looked me in the face and he said, “I’m going to make a deal with you – you come with me and I’ll keep your secret quiet.” I guess I kind of like bit his hand and he let me go and I went in the store. I was supposed to meet up with Mom and I never did, and then I met up with her eventually. And then the TV people, some news people were calling me because they wanted me to go on TV for half an hour and talk about what had happened. Somehow that got misconstrued, and instead of that we were going to talk about what it was like for a warm-weather girl to be in the snow for the first time, and that was really silly. And I don’t remember anything else in this dream, and then I woke up."
820,. It was back in my old neighborhood and my dad called Erckle from “Family Matters” and James was there.
821," Last night I had kind of an odd dream, but kind of expected. I dreamt that, well, there was something going on before, but I don’t remember what it was. All I remember now about this dream was that I was having my whole room, my studio, repainted, and not just that, but we were having the kitchen and I think the stairwell and the studio repainted, maybe even Mom’s room. And some things were all messed up and turned upside down and messed around, and you know how it is. And I was in my room here, and they had just finished repainting it, and it was twice the size that it usually is, I think because when we were repainting it when I was  just before my birthday, we did repaint it, and it was like, it looked twice the size when all the shelves and everything were out, and my desk was out because it was being repainted. And anyway, I came in and they were starting to move furniture back in, in my studio after the paint job, and my desk was like big and black and the top was wooden, but the bottom was like plastic, you know how modern things are. And on my south wall there was this cart with like a ton of books on the bottom and a ton of CD’s on the top, and it was like real ____ and said that it came from like a friend who was cleaning out the closet. And I could go through their CD’s and books and keep any of the ones that I wanted for like DJ stuff. And so I started looking through them in a very orderly manner, and I laid a few on the side that looked like good party mixes that I was going to put on and listen to once my sound system was back together, because only furniture, but nothing else, was in there at this point. And then Dad came in when I had like two or three laid aside, and he was saying something like, “Do you think you can put all this stuff back together?” meaning the sound system and all the equipment. And he said, “Then after you do that, you can resume and maintain your privacy,” or something like that, and I said, “Sure, I think I can do that.” So even though it was like a monumental task – not only the sound system, but the mixer and the computer and everything was like all, all the components and everything were just laid out on my bed. And he was like, “I think that attempt is going to fail. I know it’s going to fail.” And then I woke up."
822,. I was dating the lead singer from Maroon  and lots of other things I can’t remember.
823,"I don't exactly remember my dream, but I remember waking up thinking of Jackson."
824," You know what? I had a bizarre dream last night! I dreamt that – damn it, I keep getting interrupted. Anyway, I dreamt that I had to take three more classes at my college this summer and they were going to be like theory classes and like fun stuff, almost like art classes. And I was deciding which ones they would be. And I dreamt that Dad had this, either a violin or a dulcimer or a mandolin or something that he found either at a garage sale or in the dumpster, and he taught himself to play it. I can’t remember what song it was, but he was trying to teach himself, “Oh Shenandoah.” And he was also, he knew “This Land is Your Land,” and I was feeling his fingers and how they were moving while he was playing it, and I was thinking, “Wow, isn’t this cool? I thought he would never learn such a thing.” And he was going to teach me, but I was kind of embarrassed at first, I don’t know why. And this dream mostly consisted of those notions, and sitting out in the front yard and watching Dad play his instrument, whatever it was. And then I was in this big yellow room again and Mom was asking me what kind of classes was I going to take. And I remember she was saying it was okay if I took an online class, because I think I’ve still got it in the back of my head that I would rather take that music theory class than speech because it’s an online thing. And that’s pretty much it in a nutshell."
825,". Johnny Depp was my mom’s best friend and he came over and I was freaking out, I was like, “Oh my god, oh my god ahhh.” He was like, “Get away from me, freak,” it was funny."
826,. All I remember is that Steven was in it.
827," Last night I had a really embarrassing dream, and I don’t know where it came from or what it’s about, so I really can’t be responsible for it. I dreamt that I was in this kind of semi-dark house with a tile floor, and there was a stairway like ours and there was a light on in the stairwell. But I was sitting like on a wooden chair in the middle of this living room floor, and I was babysitting this little boy. And he was like jumping up and down on the couch and stuff, and I think there was a coffee table over in front of the couch, like in our living room. And, like I said, it had a tile floor and it was kind of semi-dark, but there was light coming in the window and there was light coming from the stairwell. And this boy – he’d come over to me and he would lean on my leg and, well, how do I say it? He would get himself hot from that. And then he would go back to jumping up and down on the couch, and I think he would do it over on the couch too. And in my dream I wasn’t really concerned or embarrassed. And then his mother was there, and I was sitting on that chair on his mother’s lap, and he was still running around, checking over things and jumping on the couch and coming back and doing the same thing. And that was really all there was to it, and then I woke up. That was crazy!"
828,. My friend Cindy and Justin and I were at this hotel and it was all ’s retro and we were like filming something.
829,"I dreamed that I was at a silent auction. I bid on a formal dress that I wanted, and I won! Then I went to help my mother and father cook dinner. Then I woke up."
830," Last night I had a bizarre dream. First, the first little theme part was that somebody was pregnant and they didn’t want their baby, so they somehow transferred it into Mom’s body, and I guess she even acted like a mama duck sitting on her eggs. She was sitting there in like her flowing robe singing, “La La Loo,” to help the baby grow, and I had to harmonize with her if I wanted to help create the baby. And so I did, and I saw in this particular scene she was on a little chair on the upstairs landing. And then, jumping to the next scene, we were on this boat and it was all dark. It was like a semi-big like private sailboat or something, and it had these tight quarters inside the cabin, and we were going up to the second floor of the cabin for some reason. And something was wrong with the boat, and in order to get it repaired, the man who was out on the boat with us had to go up to the second floor of the cabin, which you just kneel and you couldn’t stand up in the second floor of the cabin. And he had to lay down in this bed that he could just barely fit in, meaning because it was so tight and so low. And there were these bright lights that they had to turn on inside this little bed cubicle, right on the man. And this lady had to ask him questions about what was wrong with the boat under these bright lights and then she could finally fix it. But while this was going on we heard a big boom down in the lower part of the boat, and we were like, “Oh, my gosh, we have to get off.” And I was wondering if I could out of the upper floor of the cabin because it was so tight, and somehow I managed to get onto the deck. And then I woke up and I was having little dreams about us being in the kitchen listening to Bryan _______."
831,". My dad had a heart attack and I was crying so hard, we had to sell our house and move into a hotel."
832,I dreamed that I was a senior!
833," Have you noticed how when I record with this unit in here, it sounds a certain way, but when I go into my studio, the walls, there’s less stuff to absorb the sound and so the acoustics are different in there. And in the last entry I used my mom’s boom box because this one was downstairs because I was using it for my Spanish lab stuff. And so it was just different, and I just think it’s so cool, the way you can tell immediately, if you know your units, which one you used and where you were when you did it. It’s obvious I’m using my mom’s boom box again because my hand-held one’s down by the CC TV and I was using it for Spanish. Last night I was dreaming that I had to take all my equipment up to my relative’s home town, not just my mixer and my CD recorder, but my receiver and a DVD player and everything. It was like I was going to be really weighed down. And I think it was because somebody wanted me to do a gig when I got up there or something. And so I was setting things up in the living room on a little table as kind of a test run, and I had the mixer and I had a VCR that I had to connect to it, and I also had my CD recorder, and I also had, I think, a DVD player. And I was trying to figure out how in the heck was I going to connect all three of these things when I already had two sets of RCA inputs, and I could use adaptors for the other one. And I think either my cables weren’t long enough or something, but I had to do a little switching around. And then I was nailing down and explaining to Dad what the significance of having a, like a surround sound system is with DVD’s and stuff, and then I woke up. That was a very obviously literal dream because we’re going to be going here shortly."
834,". I was in this tropical place with my kid, and I was helping Stephen talk to girls. A different part of the dream I was in a yoga class and the guy next to me looked like Henry and we were talking."
835," Last night I was having a crazy dream, and it stayed with me most of the day. I dreamt that Sheryl and Sam were in town and Sandra and Lee were going to be coming real soon. I think me and Sheryl were going to go to the beach or something, and I was trying to record something and Sheryl was kind of messing it all up on purpose as a joke, and not only messing it all up, but making it obvious to everybody else what I was doing. And Sam was just kind of sitting there like, “bleah.” I think we were in the bedroom. Oh no, Sheryl and another girl and me and probably Sam were up in the bedroom up here, and we had the twin beds, like we had in the old days. I had the notion that Dad was picking up Sandra and Lee from the airport. He called home from the cell phone to say that he was coming soon, but our land line rang with the same ring tone that our cell phone rings with, and that was really weird because I was all confused. What else? Oh, in this dream I had this feeling like even though Sheryl played the joke with me, I felt closer to her and Sam than I did to Sandra and Lee. And I think it’s because she’s so distant and she hardly ever calls or writes or anything. She’s kind of like estranging herself from the family somehow because she thinks we’re not going to accept her for who she is. And she’s having all these problems and she wants to hide them from us because we’re going to say, “We told you so.” So that’s why in this dream I got the feeling like I wasn’t really as close to them, but on that regard, I kind of feel a little hurt at times because I’m her sister and she can’t even talk to me about it because she knows that I’m connected to her father and she thinks I might tell him. She never said any of this, but it’s just obvious. And I don’t remember anything more."

And there were all these incredible Alexander Calder mobiles around. The place was huge, no matter where you turned there were more rooms or stairs. There were several libraries, small rooms, kitchens, ballrooms, pools, everything. Lou kept trying to take my wings. Then I had to buy shoes or something. Then I woke up."
839," Last night I was dreaming that I had to take the Peavey system to the card party area, the ______ park thing, and we were getting it out of the garage and I was trying to get Mom to hurry up so that she could come and take me over there so that I could set it up before Dad got there. And so we were scrambling around and messing around, trying to get there on time, and I get there and I only have a certain amount of time to set up. And I started setting up the mike with the board and all, and I was, the minute, I just brought the fader up above the bottom, I was getting feedback like crazy and lots of floor noise with it, so I was trying to figure how the heck to fix that. And just about that time, you know, I don’t remember, I never started the gig before I woke up. What the heck is wrong with this stupid tape?  I don’t know, but that’s that."

843," Last night I was having a really crazy dream that I was in the Media Building of my high school. Now we know the Media Building is the building that is pretty much open air except for the classroom and has a really icky stupid elevator. Well, in my dream I was coming out of one of the classrooms of the Media Building and I was racing down the like hallway on the second floor to get to like the stairs or the elevator so I could get down because somebody was waiting to pick me up. And part of the building was under construction, and in my dream it was a lot bigger than it actually was, and I was running down the hall and I came to this little metal gap, like, you know, how you get gaps in concrete, so I kind of stepped over that. And then it was like an obstacle course. There were like rubber mats, little pools and things, screws, there was concrete that was all torn apart and several layers and levels that I was stepping down, instead of just going down the stairs. I came to this area that there’s a monument at the green point, that’s like a point in two triangles touching each other, and well, this building under construction had one of those and I was standing underneath it, and I was standing in a puddle of water and I was starting to see lightning. And I thought, “Oh, my gosh, I’m standing in a thing that’s metal and I’m ankle deep in water. I’m really scared here.” I wasn’t hearing any thunder; I was just seeing flashes. And so I climbed onto, you know how when you do construction, the windows aren’t in and you’ve got like big gaps, I jumped onto one of the window gaps and I was sitting where the window was supposed to go, yelling for help from one of the construction workers. And I had the feeling that one of them was coming to get me, but instead, Mom showed up with the car. She pulled it right up into a dirt mound, got me, and I woke up before we could go anywhere. And that’s that. Well, for one thing, I’ve been having a lot of stress lately, and it seems to be going away now that things have evened off, but I’ve just been having tons of emotional roller coaster rides, I guess you could say, because I’ve been really, really, really happy one minute and either tired or disappointed about something the next. And I guess before things started evening off today, I was feeling like I wasn’t sure if I was going to get all my stuff done on time. So that could be where I felt like I was in such a dangerous situation portrayed in the dream. Now the other things are just kind of things that played in there, like the construction is still going on across the street, and fortunately I haven’t had to go snooping in there lately. Let’s see, I don’t think there’s any buildings at my college that are like the Media Building, but there is an icky elevator in the Language Arts Building that I don’t really have the nerve to go on. I never thought I would be like that until Elizabeth brainwashed me into being afraid of elevators that aren’t quite right. And, of course, we know about Mom with the car. She’s the knight in shining armor once again because she’s going to take me off to a bunch of fun things real soon, and she always comes and gets me out of these things in real life, emotionally more than physically. And that’s just that. "
844,". My friend Cindy had never been to K-mart so my mom said we can go, just be back by ten p.m., so my friend Cindy and I went everywhere except K-mart and at : we went in and ran around, then started walking home and I was like, “Cindy, let’s just drive home,” she was like, “Oh, that would be so smart,” and we went and watched Max because Linda's mom was in the hospital."
845," I was having a really neat dream last night, one of the best organized, I think, that I’ve had in a while. Usually when I have dreams about birthday parties and Christmases and opening presents, everything is real vague and kind of distant. That’s kind of one of the reasons immediately I know that it’s a dream because it is so vague and distant. But this time I had a dream that I was having an early birthday party with Sheryl and Sandra and Sam, so that we could celebrate with them before we went to my relative’s home town, we could celebrate up there, then we could celebrate when we get back on the actual day. And for some reason Sheryl, Sandra and Sam have been showing up in my dreams a lot lately. And we were in the living room and I was opening some presents. The first, I got some books for my birthday, meaning in my dream, and I can’t remember exactly what they all were, but one of them was, it looked and smelled like the copy of A Tale of Two Cities that we got from the library, but it was some other French title by some person. And it was supposed to be one of the most profound things in literature, but I was like, I don’t think so. Then I got this other book from Dad that was like a small, about the average size of a paperback, but a little thinner, and it was supposed to be this quarterly journal like type thing about sound and stuff. And it was kind of brown and old looking, and it had yellow print on the cover that said, “How to Take Amplifier Wattage and Apply It to Speaker Power,” I think is what it said, something like that. And I’m thinking, “Okay, do they have to have such a thick volume on such a topic? I mean, not just stuff in general, but specifically that. And I started flipping through it and it was tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny print and there was a subscription card in the back, and I was thinking how it wasn’t a really a big deal that it was in tiny print because I have a CC TV. And then I got the biggest present of all. Now in my dream all these presents were wrapped in the same kind of wrapping paper, that kind of like rosish wrapping paper that I used for Mom’s TV. This present was so big that it could pass for a piece of equipment, you know, like the average size that the average box comes in that you get? Well, it was that size and I ripped it open, all excited, thinking it was going to be something like that. And it was a box, a gourmet box of chocolate-covered cherries that was just huge. I was feeling kind of a little bit let down, but yet a little excited at the same time because I was kind of expecting something else. And then as this dream goes on, it got really cool. The mermaid doll that I have, you know how it just duh duh duh duh. I don’t know what I’m saying, but you know how that is. Well, I dreamt that I found the little bag that it came in and there were these magnets, like refrigerator magnets, that you had to install, like you had to glue them to the battery compartment door so that either to make them hold the charge longer or to make them do something else. I think it was to make them do something else, but these could have not been magnets. They were either magnets or chips that you had to glue in a certain place on the door, and I was trying to figure how to do this and I didn’t know if you were supposed to glue them to the door or the side of the thing. So I was trying to find the instructions to figure that out, and there was this big, thick book that was like newsprint, like the SPC catalog, and it was yellow on the front and it had little pictures in it. And it was all these things that this company makes. It was like an exquisite ______ illusion company, for lack of a better term. But they made imaginative things that you would use in displays and setups that were based on movies, like for “The Little Mermaid” they had two or three other models similar to my doll, and they had a whole bunch of other things that were different things, like Arabian figures and stuff. And they had this other mermaid with a purple fin, purple shells and blonde hair, and I was writing down the catalog number because that’s another thing that I would want for my birthday. And then I woke up. That was messed up, man. That’s all I can say about that."
846,". Scott was sitting at lunch and was like, “Umm, there is a seat right here.” And I was like, “Ummm, no thanks.” And everybody was like, “Oh, burn” . I was looking in this huge shower, bigger than my room, and some kid came running in there butt naked screaming from this bully and then ran right back out ."
847," Last night I had a dream that Mom and I had to get on a plane, not surprisingly, but in the dream we had this flight scheduled for : in the morning. But you know how Mom is, she diddles and she daddles and she doddles and she doodles, and we didn’t get out of the house until :, so we had to take, I mean we had to reschedule to the : flight. Now in my dream the way it worked is, it would be just like a bus, you catch whichever one you can catch, but you know in life it doesn’t work that way. And so we were at the airport getting ready for this flight, and I think we were shopping around in a few of those little stores that they have, and I can’t remember a whole lot, but something happened that made us miss that one too. I think we couldn’t get on it because our bags were too big, and we had to take one that left at :. And I think before I woke up, we were finally on that flight, but we weren’t really going to get into town until : at night, which really we’re getting there at like :, or no, we’re getting there at :, but we probably won’t get to Christine’s house until :. But in my dream we wouldn’t even land until :, and I was thinking, “Oh, my gosh, what a terrible chain of domino effects this was – diddle doddle, diddle doddle, and we didn’t get out until late. Oh, my gosh.” And that’s really all there is to it. Although this dream has its literal implications about us getting on a plane and all, I think this dream referred more to life and what I feel I’m missing out on. I guess I just feel like now my dependence will never disappear, and what I could miss out on and that I might finally get to my desTheresation, but it might be much later in life than I had hoped. So that’s that."
848,"I dreamed that I was in the main hallway. Jackson was there and my friends were asking if we had played ""Roman Soldier,"" which was some sort of secret code, but I don't know what it meant.

Then I woke up."
859," Last night I had a dream that I was at my college and that I was going to take a test in English from like an English class. And they had brought in this professional test proctor and this test proctor had all the people sitting in black across part of the length of the room, just sitting on stools and taking this test. And I was at a regular desk in the back of the room, and Mom was there, and when I got my book she was going to go outside with me so we could read it, and the teacher directed me to do that. That’s what me and Elizabeth used to do. And when we got outside there were these big bumps in front of the building that I almost tripped over, and that I was crawling over so I could really feel how they were going. And then we got to a picnic table where we were going to take the test, and Mom was bringing out food and drinks and picnic stuff and we’re picnicking and talking about everything under the sun, except doing the test. And I’m telling her, “Come on, come on, I gotta take this test. I don’t know when the period’s going to end, but I have to take the test.” But she said, “You have extra time; don’t worry.” And I think that was that, and then I woke up. But before any of this, before I went into my test room, I dreamt that Mrs. Dougherty was in the hall talking to somebody, and she was going to drive up in a fire truck with a whole bunch of costumes. And she was going to whoop the siren really loud so everybody would know she was there with them."

861," Last night I had kind of a crazy dream that I was in class on Friday and that my Spanish teacher was like a gifted teacher and a Spanish teacher combined. And she was like talking about these intellectual things and all, and on Friday I dreamt that she assigned us a paper to write in Spanish about our life and how it has been unfolding up to this point. And I was thinking that I would be able to do this because I was feeling confident about being able to express myself in Spanish, but I was feeling completely distraught over the fact that I thought I was going to have a week off, but here now I have this paper that I have to do, and that I’m going to have to do it on my trip because I have no other way to do it. And then, as I was slowly fading into consciousness, I was realizing that, hey, this is a dream, I don’t even have Spanish class on Fridays and I got my Ethics paper done. And I know there was more to it, but I can’t think of it at this time. And then that was it."

Then when we got back to school, Caleb was going to go with the Varsity Girls team to their game. I was kind of upset and volunteered to drive the bus to the game so that I could be with him. Then I realized that I didn't know how to drive. The bus keeled over and Matthew came to save us. At the hockey rink, Lou was tickling me and flirting with me, and he hurt his back. I traveled to the hospital in the ambulance with him, and kissed his chest over and over again, hoping that would help in some way. Then I was just so mad about Caleb that I kept throwing things around and stomping on them. I was in a rage because he had ditched me earlier. Then I woke up."
864," We’re in my relative’s home town now, and I’m in Aunt Christine’s cellar. We sleep down here now. I had a dream last night that I was coming home from some busy kind of thing. And Dad had set me up with an interview at some pizza place, and it was mainly a job practice interview, and if I got the job, he made a comment like, “Well, I’ll have more money to sit on,” because, you know, I’m just saving up now. And so I went into this, we were riding with Mom, he and I were on a tandem and we rode down to this pizza place and we sat ourselves down at a table and Dad had brought two tuxedos – one with a straight like scoop neck and one with a flowery, flowery whoo neck. And both of these were like men’s clothes that were like way too big for me, but I was supposed to wear one of them for the interview. And the person came for me before I had a chance to put them on, and we did the interview. She asked a couple questions. She asked more questions than I offered information. Usually when I’ve done interviews with the internship program, I try to offer information like so they don’t have to ask everything and drag it out of me. But I let them drag it out of me this time. And I had to sign a form, which is like signing a statement in court, but they said I had to assent to the fact that I had a disability and I had to sign a form to do that. And then she asked some more questions, and then I went into another room where I was supposed to fill out an application, and there were these people sitting at these tables and somebody had this long involved math problem, and I took out a pencil out of my bag and I just took a shot at trying to solve it. And then about two or three steps down the way I gave up, and then I woke up. I don’t know if I got the job or not."

I was like, “Oh my go, I am so sorry. Let me kiss that for you,” so I did. Then he was like, “Let me return the favor,” but then here comes this little slut and takes him away from me. When he has to leave it was all rainy outside and he was like, “I will always miss you” and gave me a little peck on the lips. I had to move to a different school and I was so mad. I wanted to get pregnant , then I was like “No.”"
869,"I dreamed that I was in this huge dark house with a random scary guy. I had my laptop with me and was trying to shut it down. I remember wanting to go home really badly but I couldn't until my laptop shut down. The big scary random guy kept coming on to me and trying to get me to take my clothes off. He was trying to rape me, and I was really scared. So I tried to call my father, but all the numbers on the phone had been rearranged, so I couldn't figure it out. The guy was chasing after me, telling me that he was just fooling around. I started to cry, and finally I was able to call home. But I didn't know where I was! My father kept asking me where he should pick me up, and all I could say was that I was somewhere in the mountains. It was awful. The guy caught me and hung the phone up. But then Caleb came in and hit the guy and saved me. He brought me to his car and we drove for a long time. We finally got to a motel type place attached to school. Hugh started making fun of me, and I hit him square in the chest. He grabbed my hand and pulled me really close to him. Our foreheads were touching and we were about to kiss, but I was still so upset about that scary guy that I ran away. I ran into Mr. Lopez, who tried assigning me more geometry homework. I tried to do it, but it was really difficult. Everyone around me kept trying to mess me up, so I was running away, holding onto my geometry homework. Then I woke up."
870,"I first dreamed that I was in chemistry, when I realized my entire schedule had changed. I was in none of the same classes, but my entire schedule was somehow filled up. I had the opposite lunch period from all my friends, and Billy Joel was my college advisor. Then I was in my room sorting my bras, and I couldn't find the white one I was looking for. Then, I dreamed that I was sailing in the pool. There were  different kinds of boats, and I didn't know which one to use, so I asked Caleb. Pete, Sam, and some other guys kept trying to listen, so Caleb waited until they went away so he could tell me which boat to use. I distinctly remember putting my hand up to cover my mouth, even though he was the one who was whispering. Our mouths were really close again, but we pulled away before anything happened, I guess. Next, I was at some swim meet and there were bookshelves lined up for bleachers. They were really narrow, so I kept falling off onto the pool deck. People laughed at me when I fell. Mason and Isaiah were sitting on the bookshelf with me and they finally fell too when the whole thing toppled into the water. Then I lived in this house of grime. I lived right next to some huge factory, so all the dirt, grime, smoke, and ash from the factory made a film over my house. It was really disgusting. Then I woke up."
871,"I dreamed that my skin was absolutely covered in these awful boils. They were crusty and pussy and just everywhere. I couldn't wear anything because clothes irritated my skin too much. But I had to get to class by the time my Harry Potter tape finished. So I was rushing around trying to find a tank top to wear. When I got to school, it was like a bar. The lights were dim and there was cigarette smoke everywhere. My father and I looked at a Patagonia catalog, trying to find clothes that wouldn't bother my boils. I woke up scratching myself to try and make them go away, and was SO happy when I didn't actually have boils!"
872,I had a dream that there was this bulletin board for students who went missing. And I saw my own picture on it...
873,"I had a dream that there was a formal dance in the library, which was  floors. I was walking back with someone, and I guess I had a date to this dance, but I think I still needed a dress and shoes. Then it was the beginning of the year because we were all moving into Bundy again. Hannah had totally changed the room around. Then we were in the dining hall eating really good French toast. Sue was eating raisin bran. We wondered if when we were juniors we would change seats in the dining hall. I wanted more French toast, but they had run out of syrup. I had to pack my laptop up to get more. On the way, I saw Kevin dressed as a huge bug. He said, ""Hi, Bea,"" and I said, ""Nice antennae."" So then I went back to my seat and all last year's seniors were back. I tried to get the syrup, but they were taking it all. So then Sue and Charla and I were supposed to meet up later, but I woke up."
874,". Gabby was taking me, her family and Jessica somewhere but her dad kept getting mad at us."
875," There are a couple of weird dreams that I can remember that have stayed with me the past few days, because I’ve just been running around like a chicken without my head and I haven’t had a chance to put them down. So the first one I had, we were still in my relative’s home town. I mean, we were there, but I dreamt that we were here; you know how that goes. And Mrs. Dougherty was at our house, and she was laying in bed at night in the dark on Mom’s side of the bed, and there was nobody else in the bed, but we were just kind of there doing our thing. And she was laying there and I was standing, and she wanted to know how my singing technique was presently. So she wanted to sing something and have me sing it back, and have her feel how I do it. And so she sings a couple of notes like in a minor key, and it kind of scared me a little and so I grabbed her hand, but then I was okay and I sang it back to her, and she kind of felt how I breathed and how I did it. And I think she wanted to do it a couple more times, and I think maybe we did. And then I laid next to her like I do with Mom, and she held me like Mom does. And I think that was the end of that. "
876," Then I had a dream that I was in my relative’s home town, which this time I was here, but I dreamt that I was there. Well, I dreamt that I was in my relative’s home town and I was at Aunt Christine’s kitchen table, and I had a laptop and I was typing away on it. And Bobby came over and wanted to see what I was doing, and you know how in a Word document I can have either a white or a blue background and print on it to match? Well, Bobby came over and he was putting a background behind my text, and he put up this really crazy thing that was kind of like a baseball scene, and then he put up a scene of Niagra Falls, and I said, “Okay, I like that one.” And I went back to work, but I was afraid he was going to read what I was writing. And I think he was doing something else. He closed my document and he was just doing all kinds of crazy stuff. And then I realized that this thing was not just a regular thing, but it had two or three octaves of musical keys right above the typing keys, and you could go to freestyle and you could just go crazy all over the place. And about that time I faded into consciousness. That was a crazy thing."
877,"I dreamed that I went to a party at Tim's house; however, none of my friends were there. So then I went to Drivers Ed and they were all there. We had to play all these games to help us learn how to drive. Hugh was there and he kept poking me and then saying, ""You can never be my girlfriend because you can't drive yet."" Weird. So then I dreamed that it was spring carnival again and we were all Jello-wrestling. I wanted to do my laundry so I wouldn't be wearing my sticky clothes. But apparently the laundry service put your dirty clothes in bags and never washed them. Then I woke up."
878,". I was a mom in a wheelchair and my husband and I got in this fight and he threw me down the stairs, but I got up and he tried to set me on fire. But soon the whole yard caught on fire and my kids were trapped so I saved us all by putting the fire out with a fire extinguisher, then everything was ok again. Nick carried me off the bus and then kissed me. "
879,. My mom kept asking me if I had had sex before. I said no but she did not believe me. 
880," I had a pretty whacked out dream last night. I keep having dreams that I’m at this school that’s a combination of my high school and my college, and I keep waffling back and forth. I didn’t do that when I came from Bancroft and went to my high school, so I don’t know what’s going on here. But I was in the Media Building at my high school, but I was taking a class in one of the rooms like I would take at my college. And I was up on the third floor and I was with some other people. They weren’t like young people, but some of them were and some of them were like middle-aged older people. And class was kind of ending and everybody was just kind of sitting down and shuffling their books and stuff. And the fire alarm went off outside. You know how you don’t hear it in the room, but then you hear it outside in the hallway? Well, all of us took our good old time packing up our stuff. Apparently we knew it was just a drill or they were like testing it or something. So we took our good old time – that’s kind of crazy. And so – oh, I know – by the time we were ready to walk out the door, everybody had their stuff because we had to like go all together and we had to wait for everybody to pack their stuff. Well, when everybody had their stuff, the alarm shut itself off, and so I had this immense fear going on that it was going to happen again while we were out in the hallway and it was going to be terrible. And dragging my book bag and stuff, and we can’t really just go down the stairs because something is blocked or something, so we’ve got to go down these big ladder things and then walk across these like levels of concrete and then go down more big ladders and stuff. And we were all doing this with our stuff, and we got out to the, they had a bus circle at this place, and we were out to the bus circle and I thought I had missed my bus. So I was hopping a van with a lady and a couple of kids and they lived near me apparently and they were going to take me home. This van was a black van, if that makes any difference. And out there it looked like my high school. And as I was in the van, somebody said, “Well, you could take the bus. Your bus is still here. You can take the bus if you want.” And I don’t remember if I was on the bus or in the van coming home, but in my dream you had buses – school buses – to and from my college also."
881,". Three of my friends and I climbed up this big pole but we got too scared to come down. This black, bold guy kept harassing me and other people so I searched him and everyone was happy about that."
882," Last night I dreamt that Sheryl, Sandra and Sam and I were riding through town in our car and we were supposed to stop at this Catholic school that had a church attached to it, and it also had a store, and they were all red brick, and we had to do something there, but I don’t remember what. So Mom and Dad went their way and Sheryl, Sandra and I – no, I think Mom and Sheryl and Sam and I went through the school part and we were like going around peeking in these different windows, and when we would come to an exit door, it would have a little tiny sound coming from the exit like box. And some would be just a straight tone and some would be a crazy like up and down, but it was very soft, but each time I knew I could hear it. And I think we were going through the living areas and stuff, just peeking in windows. And for some reason when we came to like a, when we were just walking in a hallway, Sam handed me something, and he’s like, “Here, I bought you this.” And it was like an expensive mike to go with my mini disc recorder. And I said, “I want to pay you for it; I don’t want you to just do this by yourself.” And then we were in the car coming home and I was like trying to record what they say. They’re talking about going to school and stuff. And then I woke up."
883,"I dreamed that Johnny Depp was in the hospital and I wanted to see him. So I devised a way to pretend that one of my relatives was in the same hospital room so that I could have an excuse to see him. He had changed his appearance, accent, and everything about him, however, so that when I got to the hospital, I couldn't tell who he was. I forget who, but someone I knew ended up in the same room as this dark Transylvanian guy, who ended up being Johnny Depp. I went in the room and was about to start talking to him when the entire hospital was about to collapse. I remember seeing Caleb and Alexis and knowing that I had to save them, but then I woke up."
884,". I chased down Nate for a long time, then followed him into his house and we became friends. He brought lots of movies and came over, but we ended up babysitting a Jewish baby."
885,"I dreamed that I was in Post, but instead of looking for Caleb, I was looking for Bud. I saw him sleeping in his room and I guess he must have looked really hot, because all of a sudden, I started liking him. Then I was taking a Spanish quiz with some other kids in my class, and we were on a raft in the middle of some bay. An alligator kept dragging us into the water and when one of us would try to save the other, the alligator would grab us. So then I was in the parking lot of CVS in a huge black suburban. I wasn't supposed to be out late at night and was horrified to see my father, because he would probably yell at me for being out past my curfew. I tried to drive away, but realized that I couldn't drive. I ran Freddie Prinze Jr. over on my way home. I was horrified, but apparently he was OK. He said really sarcastically, ""Thanks, Bea. Thanks a lot."" I was so happy that he knew my name, but sad that I had run him over!"
886," Last night I was having a dream that I was at my tech school in like September, and it was really kind of disappointing because when I was walking around, I didn’t really run into any like labs or anything, anything that looked fun. But, let’s see, I don’t remember really entering, but P_________ assigned some kind of teacher to be my mentor, and I think she was a private school teacher who taught there some times. And I was walking through the building and Mom and the teacher were going to take care of some other kind of business, and while we were all sitting in this big auditorium, somebody knocked a purse over of this girl, and spilled all her change on the floor, and so they were going to pick it up and put it back in the purse for her. And this place was very well lit. It had carpet on the floor most places, and it didn’t have all those crazy colors on the floor like I remember when I actually went to the building a few years ago. And I was walking around, and there was sound everywhere, but I couldn’t actually get close enough to see where it was coming from. I was like in a kitchen when I re-met up with Mom and the teacher, and I had to practice making a sandwich or finding things because that’s what I was going to have to do, and this was a little pookie kitchen and it had like practically nothing in, that I was supposed to work in. But before that, when I was trying to work in the pookie kitchen, there was somebody messing with the sound system in like the middle of a foyer thing, setting up like a Peavey system type thing, and I couldn’t go check it out because I was confined to the pookie kitchen. And then Mom and the teacher showed up again, and we ran into Ms. Fletcher, and she was saying how some bank screwed her all up for some reason, and we walked along and we went to another kitchen, except this kitchen was full of books. It was full of like kiddie books, and there was another little closet that was dark and probably had some stuff in it, but I didn’t go in there. And then all of a sudden we were at the house and the teacher lady was sitting down and relaxing and I was sitting next to her and we were talking about things. And there were these boys that were being real boisterous at the house and they were having this party, and one of them sat down on her lap and was kind of faking a lap dance. And she yelled, “Hey, Mister, screw you!” And she threw him off, and she picked me up and walked me into the bedroom, out of that mess. And I think that’s that, I woke up."

888,"I dreamed that I lived in Manhattan. So one night I was showering and had to go get something. When I was going back to finish my shower, a man jumped out and tried to rape me. I freaked out and tried to scream, but I couldn't make any sound. It was awful. I tried to tell My mother what happened, but I had lost my voice. Thank god I woke up!"
889,". There was an evil lady that ruled us and we had to ask permission for everything, then we had to go into training, and I helped but got in trouble for talking without permission.

890,"I dreamed that my father and I had to get secretly married. We were in some foreign country where that was the law. After we were married, we had to race back home. I couldn't fit everything into my suitcase, so I had to pack extra bags of all my stuff. When we got home, the whole cast of Friends was at my house. I told my father that the next time I got married, I wanted to have a white dress and that I wanted to marry someone that I loved in that way, not because it was the law. Then I woke up. Weird."

893,"I only remember a small portion of this dream. I was hanging out on the roof with some friends. From what I can remember it was dan, marston, chris, marty and frankie. I was layin down on a lounge chair lookin up at the stars, it was nighttime, the sky was phenomenal. I remember watching as the earth rotated quite quickly. Of course the sun never actually came up, it stayed night, yet the stars just kept going around and around and around really fast, as if it was normal. We were all just layin there lookin up in awe. That's all I remember, it was pretty cool."
894,". Greg S. was there because one guy had to go away, so I said I would take his place and Greg was his best friend. They snuck out every night to go to a cave, and I got to talk to him. Never went to cave. I had two kids and was going to get my hair colored, Jessica E. was there and so was CH."

898," Last night I had a dream that we took a trip to my relative’s home town, and that this dream, the setting of this dream was like home. And for some – I don’t remember too much, because again I let this go all day. I’m getting bad about that, so I forget most of them now. But Dad and Mom and I were like in a connecting airport, but we were outside on this deck and looking over like a roof into the city. And this thing was like a floating deck dock thing. It was like flying on air and it was like trampoline. We were jumping up and down on a trampoline. And in my dream Dad and I were holding hands and were like trampoline jumping back to the main terminal, which was like about ten foot square on the deck, and Mom was over in a chair by the main terminal. And I was thinking how trampoline jumping might bring back a bunch of scary stuff if we do too many maneuvers, but that wasn’t a part really that much of it. And then I was thinking how nothing better happen with this plane because in my dream we were getting home from my relative’s home town on a Sunday and I started class Monday morning, the next day, which fortunately on the way home everything went well on our real trip, and I could pull that off. But in my dream I don’t think anything went wrong, and I think we just about made it onto the plane on time because we were waiting for them to call us, and they weren’t calling us and weren’t calling us, and we figured we’d better check and make sure everything is okay. And so we got on the plane and it was like, just like riding in a car, except we were riding along the interstate, and, you know, how do you slow down, you brake at a red light and you speed up and accelerate. Well, that’s how this thing was. It was a vehicle with wings and the windshield was open and the windows were open, and it was like, it wasn’t really a plane at all; it was a car. And then I woke up."
899,". I can’t really remember, but I kept on saying, “I can lose weight but you’ll always be ugly.”"
900," Last night I had a pretty strange dream. I dreamt that I was supposed to go over and see Mercy Stinton, and I went over there to her apartment complex, and I had to get the  floor, and I was going upstairs and going upstairs and going upstairs and going upstairs. And this apartment complex had like apartments that were on like the outside, like on a balcony, they weren’t all enclosed in a hallway. And, oh, let’s see – I got to the  floor and knocked on their door, and the wrong person answered, and I said, “Do you where Mercy Stinton’s apartment is?” and in my dream it was . And he said, “No, I don’t.” And he was like going to page somebody on his cell phone, but he said, “This is the  floor.” And I was like, “Oh, that helps.” Then I was like trying to figure out how to get up to the next floor and I couldn’t figure it out, and there was all kinds of garbage and stuff around. And I think also that to get somebody, I had to go back home and help me get somebody to help me find it. And I called her and I said I was going to be a little late, and she just, she was so worried about me, and then I, people were just dawdling around the house and I had to call her and tell her I couldn’t make it. And that was that."
901,"I dreamed that I was  and I went to a college that was similar to my high school. We had an all school meeting on day to address the issue of diversity. I had been asleep that night when some boy came into my room and wrote his name, address, and phone number on my ceiling. Apparently he was initiating some important moment, but I didn't understand. We then talked about terrorist bombings in Rome and Angels and Demons. I also dreamed that there was a TV show about killing wild cats. And I was on it, except I had no weapons! Lastly, I dreamed that Ed was rifling through all my stuff, but I don't know why."
902," Last night – I know this is going to sound extremely impossible and unnatural – but last night I dreamt that Celine Dion was in our kitchen , actually what was happening was I was feeding the chickens and I heard Mom playing one of her albums, and I decided to come in. And she actually opened the door and was singing one of her French songs; she was singing “Brahms Lullaby” in French. I knew it and I sang along with her, and next thing I knew, we were at the counter and we like put our heads against each other and sang it like in full voice. And that was kind of incredible, and then there was something else going on. And then I was asking her, “Your new album, why were some of the tracks recorded in Stockholm, Sweden?” And she was like, “Well, it was put together by something in England and France.” And I was like, “Oh.” And I dreamt that she was supposed to appear at WLFA for a publicity thing to raise money for something. And I don’t remember what, but next I knew, I was on the phone with Sheryl, Sandra and Sam and we were all going to go on a boat trip and take this puppy that was not house potty trained, and was messing all over the place. And then I woke up."
903,. All I remember is Stephen making pancakes.
904,". I took a note of Nathan's and I was madly in love with him, so he sat on top of me and held me down and started to tickle me, but I still did not give it back. So he kissed my forehead, but it still did not work so he gave up."
905," Last night I had a bizarre dream. I dreamt that I was planning to go to Iraq with my class of some people from, I think, one of my humanities classes at my college, and not really for any serious negotiation, but just as tourists. They were going to show us how it is over there. And one of the main things that was important to know was that each little town square center thing had like this fountain thing with a telescope in the middle of it. And what you had to do when you were going to speak to people in the town square is about two or three feet away – or maybe four feet – stand up on this little stool and point an unloaded gun at the telescope thing so that they could see that you had no bullets in it. That was crazy! And so we had one of these little setups in our living room so that I could practice doing it, and I had a feeling like I wanted to get up on a stool thing and speak to those people, but I had no idea what the heck I wanted to say. And I guess this comes from when I hear about it on the news, I have no clue what it actually looks like over there. I can’t really imagine. I’ve never really actually looked at the footage. I guess I should sometime. And in other parts of this dream I dreamt that Sheryl, Sandra and Sam were in town and we were in the car going somewhere, and we were stopping along the way at this "
906,". Like I was at this one place with some friends and I had an old cell phone in case of  and I called it on accident. They said it was OK but then we were getting robbed, so I called it again and I got so scared."
907,. CH and Rachel were there.
908,"I had a dream that the girls' lacrosse team had a really early game one day or something, so they had to wake up at  on Sunday. Leanne was complaining that this was unfair because no one else had to wake up, so she demanded that the entire school wake up at  as well. I turned to her and snapped, ""It's going to be really unfair when you get into Princeton because of your lacrosse skills, when far more deserving people get turned down, especially when they are much smarter than you!"" That shut her up! Then I had a dream that I was in a store and had a fixed amount of money. I bought a pink iPod and a bottle of Chanel perfume. Then I decided to buy different perfume. And then I woke up, but had none of my purchases!"
909,". I bought lunch in an elementary school. Cara had a car and would take me places. And then I was on the bus with Spencer and I am all like, “How do you get your hair so bouncy?) and he is all, “Conditioner.” I was all like, “What kind?” We got off at this one stop and went into the shower, it was only to show me the shampoo. We talked and stuff and got back on the bus and talked some more. Taylor was there. I asked him to go to a movie."
910,I dreamed that we were moving into Hannah's house in Florida. I was getting a huge room that overlooked the pool! Then I woke up.
911," Last night I had an unbelievably absurd dream. I can’t remember how or when or why, but somebody in my dream was trying to tell me the HIV virus was responsible for causing my underdeveloped optic nerve, and that it was going to spread to the rest of my body sometime in my life, and it was going to turn into AIDS. I actually believed it for the duration of the dream, and it wasn’t really all that scary, but then again it kind of was a little bit. And I can’t remember anything else that was going on in the dream, but there was a whole bunch of other stuff that wasn’t related. But I don’t remember any more of it, because, like I said before, I let this go like this is the evening time now, and it stayed with me this whole day. But that’s that. It was really, really crazy. Then, as I was waking up, I was thinking how that probably wasn’t true, but until I was really awake, I couldn’t be absolutely sure."
912," Last night I had a dream, but I can’t remember much about it, but I do remember this part that was very distinct, and it probably might mean something, I don’t know. Up – you know how in the landing of the stairwell here – there’s a little round table that the old CC TV has been kind of placed on, and I like have been using it from time to time. Well, in my dream, standing on top of the monitor was a big, huge, about ’ tall – and almost as tall as me – it was a Santa display figure doll thing, and it was standing on top of the CC TV monitor. And you would activate it and it would just sway. It was supposed to like dance, but when he spread his arms, it was like this big, huge mess, just swaying and swaying and kind of making a noise and flashing some lights and playing a little Christmas song. But I would get nervous about this thing falling off because it would sway so wide, and I didn’t really think it was going to fall off, I just thought it might. And that’s really all I can remember. I think I was going to take it to a party or something, but I don’t remember anything…. Now I remember some more about this dream. It had no connection to the Santa thing, but I dreamt that we were walking from an apartment in N______ Park over to the campus, and it was sort of a nice walk. I mean, we were seeing roses and stuff. But I was living upstairs in kind of a dingy place, and it was kind of small and blah, and so we were on this walk, showing me the way to my tech school, and next thing I know, I’m back home at this house messing with that Santa thing again. I don’t get it."

915,. My mom was saying that I was ugly.
916," Last night I had a bizarre dream. I dreamt that we were still looking at apartments for me for when I’m living at my tech school, and I dreamt that this place – Winter Park Villas – was on a ship and there were rooms and rooms for people to stay, but it was like on a ship. And it didn’t really have an address because it didn’t stay in one place; it could get up and go at any minute. And I was thinking to myself how I would really like to stay at a place that was on land, and I wouldn’t want to stay on a ship. And there was another part to this dream. There was a waiter guy who had to come to my room in order to get to either the ship’s bathroom or like a kitchen storehouse place, but he came through there a couple times, and he ended up sleeping in my bed. And in my dream I didn’t really consciously think he did anything to me, but I kind of asked Mom that, if I needed to get an abortion, would she be able to take me in, not let anybody know. And I don’t remember what she said, but next thing I knew, we were "

920,". I got a purple letter in the mail and it was a response from Johnny Depp and inside it had an autographed picture of him, then a whole bunch of pics of him and a letter that said something like, “Wow, you really love me, sorry my handwriting is so bad.” I was freaking out, then I looked out my window and there was some totally hot guy with no shirt on that looked like Johnny Depp. So I knocked out my screen and jumped out the window to him and was like, “JOHNNY DEPP!” And he was like, “No, I am your neighbor, nice to meet you!” … meme was there very young and healthy."
921," Last night I had a really crazy dream. I dreamt that I was at this Spanish class like take in my high school, except it was at this dingy old house and I was coloring in a color book, and it was a coloring book of like Bible stories and stuff. And I had been there for like three or four hours just doing nothing, and I was going to call home, but for whatever reason, I couldn’t really dial the cell phone. It had all this like Spanish instruction stuff on the display and we couldn’t really, I don’t know, you couldn’t really get out. And then I realized that I had to go  and , ,  and then , and then I was able to get out of all that messy Spanish stuff, and I can’t remember if I actually got to talk to anybody, but then I woke up."
922,"I don't remember all the details but here is what I do remember. Marley, my cat, decided to escape. He ran outside and I had to chase him across the street and catch him. We were back in Virginia at my mom's house. I caught him and brought him back in and then he escaped again. It really upset me the  time because I wasn't able to find him. That's all I remember."
923," I still have to think about that sometimes!  I can’t remember too much about what I was dreaming last night, but I know that, I remember one scene real vividly. I dreamt that I think I might have been at either Aunt Christine’s house or at some other strange house. But I had a feeling like it was somebody’s house that I had just been to the first time. And I didn’t really know the people, and they had like an upper second story, and they had a living room real similar to ours. And then they had a cellar and the stairs are just like ours except they were a lot less steep, they went at a much more gradual grade for a much longer period of distance. And I had to go get something from in their cellar, and, oh no, I think I had to go to the bathroom down there. And what you had to go is you had to go down the steps, and then there was like a hallway, and to your right was a bathroom, to the left was some other kind of junk room, and if you kept going straight and down a couple more steps, you’d have an even deeper, darker cellar. And by the way, in all of this, there was one light switch at the head of the stairs that controlled the lights for all three of those rooms down there and the stairway. And I had to go to the bathroom and somebody was in the first story bathroom, and I was going down the stairs of the cellar, and it didn’t actually happen, but I was having a vision of what would happen if somebody were to see the door open and the light on, and they just switched off the switch and everything went dark, how I would just scream! And after that thought, I decided I wasn’t going to go to the bathroom down there, that I was going to hold it some more. So then I woke up, and I really had to go. "
924,"I dreamed that I had sex with Doug. It was such a weird, vivid dream. We were in this huge, hot room, and then we just started stripping and had sex. He said it was the  happiest moment in his life. Then the rest of the school began to walk in and we started getting dressed really quickly. I didn't even know I could dream about having sex since I haven't had it yet! At least in my dream it was good and not scary!"
925," Oh, I smell coffee somewhere! Okay, last night I had kind of a crazy dream. I dreamt that I was in the Bancroft Middle School cafeteria, and people were getting ready to take a test, like an FCAT or something, and they were all sitting at the table. And over in a corner my mom was shoveling big plops of poop into a bucket, and I don’t know where that came from, but she was saying, “Getting the dirty stink out of the cafeteria would help them take their tests.” Well, duh! And then I must have been roaming around my high school or something, in the hall in front of the Guidance Office, and I heard them announcing the final exam schedule for my college over the intercom. And I was thinking how the high school students, they threaten them and they say, “If you don’t get your exam by the scheduled time, the door’s going to be locked and you won’t get to.” And they just say, “First period, second period, go to your next period exam.” But at my college, when they read their exam schedule, they were a lot more, not really empathetic, but sort of along that line, trusting that the college students would know what the heck they were doing. And that’s all I can really remember about this dream."
926,"Weird dream. I remember I was starting some new job or something. I needed some money to get by before the job started. My mom gave me  checks. One for $ and then a second one  for $. The second check didn't have the date on it and I pointed that out to my mom. I arrived at this place with  other girls. We were driving and we were in some sort of parking structure. We were driving around trying to find a space. For some reason I didn't really like the girls I was with. Now we left the car and are in some sort of mall. We have to buy some clothes for the new job. I don't remember actually shopping for clothes though. At one point we walk down a hallway and enter an elevator. Then we are in this room all sitting in chairs going through some sort of orientation. My current boss is there talking to us. She points me out for some reason and then shows everyone a shirt I bought. Then she reads some piece of paper saying my favorite movie was ""Big Fish"". I haven't even seen that movie yet in real life. I protested and explained that that information was wrong and it was not my favorite movie. Finally my boss stepped out for a few minutes and I realized I did not want to be there and did not want this job. I felt very stressed and wanted to get out of there. I walk into the next room and try to call my mom but I can't get through. So I dial the operator and tell her I want to make a collect call. I give her my mom's number  and the operator made the call. I heard my mom answer but she couldn't hear me. I heard her and the operator talking and I was getting very frustrated because I wanted to talk to her. I remember my mom mentioned something about the word/number google however she said the word wrong and I was trying to tell the operator the correct word. I was so frustrated at this point I started crying. I just wanted to talk to my mom and get the hell out of there. That's all I rememeber."
927,. Greg came up to meet me at lunch and he was so totally flirting with me.
928,"So I'm layin in bed sleepin with someone and I wake up and realize that we need to take a shower before work. I look over towards the bathroom and I see that there is a girl in the tub singing and a band playing. There are these chairs on the floor outside of the tub and she keeps jumping out of the tub and falling into the chairs as if she's diving into a crowd, I find this rather strange. Then I realize that this isn't even my house. I suggest that we go next door and shower instead. Suddenly there is a knock at the door. I peek out and it's some girl and about  or  other people. I open the door and explain that the person who lives there  is not home and that we are staying there and are in bed. She seems to not care and pushes her way through the door. This pisses me off but what can I really do about it. Then the alarm went off again and I woke up."
929,. I was really popular and I went to Hewston’s house and I was drifting in a river and no one would save me.
930," Last night I had pretty cool, strange dreams. They came in like little chunks. The first thing I can remember is that some relatives were in town, and I think it was Arlene and Larry and Jack and Polly, and it was Christmas time. And we were doing something downtown and I think Sheryl, Sandra and Sam were there, in addition to these other people. And we were going around downtown and doing stuff, and there was some kind of exhibit show in the Coliseum and we were walking around. And then there was supposed to be a Celine Dion concert like the Las Vegas show, and apparently because it wasn’t making too much money up there, it had to tour and it had to come down and go to another place. And so I was thinking, “Oh, man, we don’t even have to pay  bucks to get it; we’re already in.” And Mom’s like, “Well, I don’t know, we’ve got people to go do stuff with and we don’t know what they’re doing and what their plans are” and stuff. And so we went outside and we started walking down the road and then I found out that Mom and Dad had bought two tickets for the concert for Christmas for me, and so we went back in, and Mom kept stalling and stalling doing different things, and finally we got in and we got to our seats. And this heavy metal guitar person opened for her, and then when it was her turn to come out and take the stage, they pulled down a movie screen and I found out it wasn’t going to be a concert. They were going to show a horror movie that she starred in. And I was like, “What!?” "
931," … This is another tape continuing April  with a different little chunk of my string of unconnected dream scenes. This one was when I was, I felt like I was in a house that was kind of like our house and kind of like somebody else’s house. And there were a bunch of people that I didn’t really know, but I felt were friendly, and they were like people I think I was trying to get to know, like college age people. And I dreamt that in my Basic Electronics class, when we passed the final exam, we were given a little card that said that you were like a certified basic person, basically. And it was shaped just like my Best Buy gift card and it had the hologram on the front, and the credentials were printed on the back. And it had a little tiny picture of the music major down in the lower left-hand corner of the back, and a little further like in the middle of the card there was a little tiny picture of like a UPC symbol on the bottom right. And I was sitting kind of in a big roly chair looking at something that was kind of a combination of a computer and a CC TV. And I put this card under my tray and I was looking at it, and three boys and two girls all around were like, “Oh wow, cool, you actually got one of these cards. Oh, my gosh!” And there was this big dog, but she was real friendly. I had a feeling it was a she; I don’t remember what they were calling her, but she was big. Her shoulders came up to my chest. She liked to kind of make it so that my hand’s looped in her collar, and she would pull my chair along with her as she walked. And she pulled me back a little bit. "
932," And then I was in the bedroom of this house, that was like our house, and I was with two of the other boys, and I was putting together this really strange contraption. I had a black tube that was about three feet long, and it was about, it had two speakers attached to it kind of taped on with electrical tape at either end of the tube. And there were wires in the middle of the tube that connected them, and in the middle of this, that would come up from the tube vertically like a T, and on top of that I was going to put some kind of a – like a control unit like type thing, like – I don’t know – a crazy box. I don’t know what it was supposed to do, but I wanted to rig it so that there was like a display that I wanted to rig on the outside of the tube, and I was soldering these wires all together so the thing would work. And I took the control box and I laid it face down on the bed, and I had this little bin of fasteners and I had this soldering iron that was about as heavy as a drill, and it was sort of, it had a wide, round tip that had a little boop in the center, and it had the solder within it instead of on a separate little thing. And what you would do is you would heat it up and you’d tip it upside down on the tip, and you would dab a little bit on and it would melt and you’d stick on whatever you wanted to stick on while it was still liquid. And I had these fasteners that were wires with little round tips at the end, so I was laying them in the thing, laying them in the blob of solder that I put on the terminals, and when I was done with this iron thing, I would like lay it on the bed. And worse yet, I would lay it on a newspaper on the bed. And when I woke up, I thought, “Oh, my gosh, why the heck would I do something like that?” And there were these two boys just watching what I was doing, and they were kind of jiggling and jury-rigging the wires inside this tube. And then I woke up."
933,I dreamed that Samantha and I were in some -star hotel and we had to take a train somewhere. It was pouring rain. That's all I remember.
934,". I got hit by all these weird bugs and crap, then I went outside and Nick was out there with a posse asking if I was ok. Then he took me to this weird store. We were waiting in line forever and we did not even know what it was for. When we got there it was awesome! But then the ride was so lame, so we were really pissed off."
935," Last night I had kind of an interesting dream. I dreamt that my Spanish class was hosting this party. I think it was for some new guests or something. And we were kind of at a place that was kind of like our house and kind of like something different. And we were arranging this buffet on our dining table, and I had given them two little Styrofoam balls and they crafted one to look like a pond and they put water in it, and they crafted another to look like a fountain. And they made this house out of cardboard with a big roof and white in the front, and they made it sort of longer than higher, and that was kind of a backdrop of the buffet. And I think I climbed up on the chair at the side of the table, and I grabbed the jug of water and I poured myself a glass. And then I went along down through the buffet and I got through these things. And I can’t remember what the significance of all this was. There had to be more to it, but heck if I remember."
936,"I dreamed that Lou and I were in an elevator folding laundry, and he started massaging my shoulders. I got all tingly. Then I massaged his. Then we started kissing in the elevator, and I put my hand on his chest. For some reason, that felt really sexual and I woke up kind of embarrassed, even though nothing really happened."
937," Last night I had a dream that I was participating in this NFD convention that was held in this stadium and outside, and we were walking around looking at different things. It was Mom and me and Terri that was there. And they were like, there was like a DJ and they were playing different CD’s and stuff. Then we went to like the second level. In this particular stadium there were like where the, down on the field where most of the booths were, then there was a second level where some other – it was like a thin little circle of fields that was a second level where other displays and booths were that were around. And we went back into a hall because we were looking for the bathroom. We found this audio booth where this girl was mixing, and I thought I used to know her. She reminded me of Charity, the neighbor down the street, but I didn’t know who she was in my dream. She was doing the mixing and stuff, and she was waiting for her next shift to come, and nobody else wanted to take over for her and she was kind of upset that nobody would take over for her. Terri, she asked if Terri would take over for her, and Terri was like, “Nah, I don’t do that kind of stuff.” And I had to cut in between in, I kind of waved my hand like you do in school, and waved it and shouted and cut in between them, and I said, “I would be happy to take over for you if you teach me how to run your system.” And fortunately – you know how like a band plays and then there’s like a lull when they take a break – well, fortunately I guess DJ’s don’t take breaks, but it was sort of a break phase while she was teaching me. This room that the equipment was in kind of put me to mind of the Double Vision room, and as much video equipment as they had in the Double Vision room, this was all audio equipment. She took me like from one thing to the next and like put my hand on it, and I was able to feel the front panel on each device, and I was able to sort of know what it is. I don’t remember the most important thing. They did not have a mixer. Shame on them! But had three CD’s players. The first and the second one,  or  knobs across the front that were supposed to be like EQ things, and then they had the usual transport controls underneath the tray. And then they had a third CD player that was like a cream-colored personal CD player. Then they had two other weirdo things that I’ve never seen before. Oh, and then they had like tons of CD’s, but I don’t remember a mixer or an amplifier. How in the heck are we supposed to mix without a mixer? But anyway, I remember wishing that I had brought my magnifier so that I could at least try to read some of the titles, because after she left and she said like, “It’s all yours,” I think Mom and Terri went to do something else. And I was just taking time to look through their collection and see what I could see. And they had tapes of stuff that you listened to that was recorded, books and stuff, and they had CD’s that were kind of blah, but the good stuff that she was playing I couldn’t find. I wasn’t looking in the right place. And I felt like I was doing a terrible mix because I wasn’t playing stuff that was appropriate for the crowd because I didn’t know what I was going to queue up because I couldn’t read the darned things and I didn’t, like with my collection I know what’s where. Well, this one I just had no clue. And then we were home – man, I’m using up tape like crazy – we were at home watching movies, and I think it was “Brother Bear” with sort of a crazy spin on it and when the movie ended, I think for some reason the amplifier was in the middle of the foyer with no wires attached to it. But I could still turn the volume down on the front and the volume would still go down and it would still control things. That was crazy! And I was picking up all these lettuce leaves off the couch, and I was putting them into this green container and crying for some reason. And these lettuce leaves had to go back to Block Buster with the movie, why I do not know. But Dad was like, “Are you crying like the Toyota?” And I was like, “No, I’ve got a stuffy nose and I always breathe like that when I have a stuffy nose.” And then I woke up."
938," Last night I had a whacked out dream, man. I think the first part was that we were at this school, and their big auditorium, and we were watching these kids perform, and they were dancing around in a big circle in pilgrim dresses and stuff. And there was, then the circle, they disbanded from the circle and they would take turns singing and all. Their accompanist was at a grand piano, and the keys weren’t out lateral, they were like typewriter keys, all sort of on top of each other. And the guy, all the kids finished performing and the guy was like trying to tune it or something and he had the lid lifted, and there was fire. There was a different color flame for each note and for different chords the different flames had to sort of mix. That was so messed up, man. I don’t know where that came from. But then the next scene was that I was at like a beach thing. I think it had something to do with a scholarship convention, and I was swimming with Mom. It started off to be that I was at a boat ramp and Mom and I sort of strayed from the band and people that were there, and we started swimming. And the first weird thing was that there was a boat coming and we didn’t want to get run over and so he’s like, “Come on down,” we’ve got to get under the water so that this boat can go over us. And so we went under, and I was able to breathe under water because apparently there was a little air pocket that sort of came down with us, you know how things get. And then when we came up again, I noticed that we were two-thirds of the way across this bridge that was like, I don’t know, fifteen or twenty feet long that was supposed to be the skyway, but it was too small to be the skyway. We were swimming to this little island, and Mom wanted to go in this little pet store and get food for the people’s dog that we were staying with, but I was swimming naked and I didn’t want to get out of the water, so I waited for her. And I started swimming back across the thing by the bridge, and on the other side there was like a turtle, and I touched the turtle, and then he immediately wanted to bite me. And I threw handfuls of sand at him so he would bite the sand and not me and I could get away. But he kept following me, following me, following me, and finally I just forgot about it and I went up on top of this bridge and I forgot all about the fact that I had been swimming naked, and they were like giving out like scholarship awards at this little pavilion. And I knew I was supposed to be one of them and I hoped that Mom would come over from the pet store in time. And I think that was it."
939,"So I had company Thursday night, he had to leave with short notice early Friday morning. I go back to sleep at about . I dream that I am in my apartment and these girls stop by. They wanted to come in and see my place but I wouldn't let them. Then I remember seeing these  little toy poodles, for some reason I thought they belonged to the rapper Jay-Z. Then my company who had left earlier that morning, came back in my dream. This seemed all too real. I opened the door and he came back inside. I was very happy to see him. We got in bed and snuggled and talked. Then for some reason I gave him a hickey on his arm. It was on his forearm and he was a bit pissed about it because now he was going to have to wear a long sleeved shirt until it went away. I felt really bad and apologized. He forgave me and we just laid there, holding eachother for awhile. Then I woke up and was very sad and disappointed that it had been a dream. I really thought he had come back and was completely bummed."
940,"This dream took place early Saturday morning. I was looking to score some cocaine and I went to the ATM. Some guy  came with me. I withdrew some money and then this black dude came up to me, he had a gun and made me give him my money. I remember being able to stick $ of it in my pocket before he saw me. So now I am back at my place and my neighbor hands me these  little bags of coke. Now it was supposed to be  gram but I was like, there's no way this is a gram of coke, not even if you put the  bags together. I had another bag on me and took it out and showed him the difference. Then I explained I would gladly weigh it to see how much it really was. He didn't seem upset at this or anything. That's all I rememeber"
941,"I dreamed that I was at this little grocery store in the middle of nowhere, trying to get food. There were things there called push-kins, which were supposed to be mock Fig Newtons. Then I woke up."
942," Last night I dreamt that I had a wedding planned to a guy that I didn’t even know hardly. He was somebody that I expected to get to know and we expected to hit it off really well. And Dad was like, “Well, you should set up a wedding. You should get ready. You should have everything all set _____ the way you wanted to.” And so we set up so that we could have a reception at the Hilton, and then about a little while later he reminded that it was still set up and that it couldn’t be cancelled because I wasn’t really starting to get to know him, like he wasn’t returning my calls and stuff. And he reminded me that time was running out to get to know him, and I just said, “Okay, enough of this.” I ___________, but in my dream I did a bunch of crying and then finally I went to them and said, “Look, I’ll give you the money that it takes to cancel the thing, but I want you to cancel it.” And then he was like, “Well, you were the one that set it up,” and this and that, and I was thinking, “No, I didn’t. You were the one that made me.” And I think there was something else. I think Mom had found this really small premie baby and picked it up, sort of like you pick up a hurt bird and take it home and take care of it. So she sort of picked it up, it was abandoned, and she brought it home, and then we had a baby in the house, plus all this other stuff going on. And, oh yeah, one other additional part to this dream: I dreamt that I was at some kind of class that was teaching me how to do something technical. I think I was at a thing that was sort of a cross between a CC TV and a computer, and I don’t remember what I was doing, but she was trying to get a feel for how much I knew. I was working with this lady, and I was kind of going off and thinking about my own thing, and I wasn’t able to do what I was supposed to do. And I was too preoccupied by this heavy stuff about this stupid wedding. And then I think I woke up."
943,I was on some ship and remember looking out this window that looked straight up at the sky. I see what looks like a meteor shower. Then it turns into fireworks. I watch the fireworks in amazement. Then I see clouds overhead and they look like storm clouds. The ship starts rocking back and forth as the ocean becomes very violent. I run down to this stall where this horse is supposed to be to make sure it's ok. It was a black horse and the horse was scared but doing fine. I guess then we docked and I got off the ship. I was walking around this quaint town. I see this big tub of m&m's and jump in it and then realize it's very deep and I can't get out. There are these two characters  who are there joking with me about it and saying that I shouldn't be swimming in the m&m's. Next thing I know the tub empties out and I am standing there and the  characters are joking with me about it. Then I run into Frankie and we talk about something although I can't really recall what. Then I'm in this room going over gifts that I am going to give my family. I start moving them around and I see this photo of the cast from the Soprano's. I remember that this is a gift I wanted to give to James Gandolfini . So I walk into the other room where James is and I sit down on his lap and show him the photo that I have for him. He appears to be very touched. Then I woke up.
944,"I had a dream about Ecstacy. I didn't actually take any I just remember it being important in the dream somehow. Then I had this list of words and had to rate the words in some way. I'm guessing it was something like when you take ecstacy do you feel this way, then you would rate that word from   to  . There was also this girl who needed help with her homework or something. I said I could assist her even though I was working full time and going to school. Then there was this little boy who was walking down the sidewalk. There was an octopus on the sidewalk and he jumped over it so not to step on it. Right after that someone else walked by and stepped right on top of it and ink shot out."
945,"So Marty, Chris & I go to some rave. It was in the gym of some highschool. I remember taking a yellow E pill, I had  but only took one. I also had purchased  red pills called Red Monsters. I didn't take those either. Whenever I take E I always get sick so I was just waiting for it to hit me. I went into the bathroom and waited for awhile. After awhile nothing happened so I went back downstairs. There were a lot of people and I was just observing everything. I was getting frustrated because I didn't feel the E yet. I went back to the bathroom and hung out again and it was quite crowded. I didn't want to get sick in a crowded bathroom. I overhear a security guard saying there is another bathroom upstairs that most people didn't know about. So I leave that bathroom and follow the signs for the other one. I take this escalator upstairs. It wasn't your typical escalator. It kinda turned and twisted. I rode it up to the top and then realized I had forgotten my shoes. So I road the escalator all the way back down. I got down to the other bathroom and there was this guy standing outside the bathroom, he looked like a very muscular Brendan Fraser. Supposedly I worked with him. He said hi to me and went on to explain that he was going on some cruise on Sunday and Linkin Park was performing. Then he asked me if I worked on Sunday, and I was like ""Yeah right, me work on Sunday?"". I found my shoes and then went back downstairs. I thought I was beginning to feel the E but I really couldn't tell. Then my phone rings. I pick it up and it showed someone had called but didn't list the number. Then it rang again. I answered and it was a girl named Lisa who was dating Scott. Somehow it was explained to me that she had a list of about  people who she was allowed to call and I was one of them . So she starts talking to me about how her and Scott are going to have to put their dog to sleep and how she was extremely upset about it. I go back into the rave to try to find Chris & Marty and then I woke up."
946," Last night I dreamt that it was my birthday, of all things, probably because of the mermaid birthday story, and because on ______’s day I kept wanting to say, “Happy birthday.” I dreamt that I was up here in my bedroom for most of the dream, and Carl was giving me two presents. I can’t remember exactly what they were, but they were kind of juicy things that somehow I could use. They were kind of like utilitarian gifts. And the first one, I think, was some kind of clear plastic clipboard, and it had some words on it. It was like an overhead projector clipboard. The next present that he gave me was like a cone thing that you yell through. It was cardboard, and it had like some blue stars on it. Now what’s up with that, I don’t know! But he wrapped it up in a box real pretty. And then Mom, a little while later after he left, Mom was going to give me a present and it was supposed to be The Present of all presents, if you know what I mean. It was supposed to be the one present I’ve been wanting a long time. And somehow I got ticked off, but I didn’t want her to know. And it was like a small kind of box wrapped in white paper with some flowers. And I opened it up and it was a baby thing. And it kind of shrunk a little more as I looked at it, and it was white – I don’t know – but even though it was small and babyish, I remember being pleased, really, really, really pleased. And then I woke up."
947,"So I am at some place and it's raining outside, it's night time. We  suddenly realize if we don't open windows we will suffocate. not sure why. So we are running around the house opening all the windows. Then I am in this office and I see this guy and girl. I later remember that the girl was supposed to have been in some type of accident and was supposed to be wearing a neck brace, yet she didn't have it on. This next scene was more like me daydreaming w/ in the dream. Rather then it really happening I was just imagining this sequence. I imagined that I had taken a picture of the girl without her neck brace and then the guy found out and was pissed. He wanted to come after me and was likely to kill me. Thankfully it wasn't really going to happen so I didn't get scared. Then I am in this dark room lying down sleeping. I suddenly feel myself moving like I was on some sort of conveyor belt. It was pitch black and I couldn't see. I just felt myself moving and could feel a breeze. Finally it comes to a stop and I get up and go into a room. Michael Jackson is there and he has brought us all there to do something important, although not sure what. I remember wondering why he would do that and why he picked the people he did. He said it was because we all had charisma. Then this one black guy, who I used to work with, comes into the room. I go up and say hi and give him a hug."
948,I dreamed that Lou wanted to have sex with me.
949," Last night we stayed in a hotel, we were up at Jackson, and I had the dream while I was there. I dreamed that I was raising and hatching these baby chicks; there were about five or six of them, and I had eggs in an incubator. And I don’t remember too much about the incubator part, but it was like this box that I had that I was hatching these eggs. And it was like a f______ project, and I seem to remember the chickies coming out, and there were three yellow ones, a brown one and two black ones. And, you know, they were hopping around doing their thing, and I was thinking, “Oh, how cute! I can take these to the fair and show them.” And then, I can’t remember, something else was going on. Some elderly woman took me to this big, open hall type thing, and there was tons of stuff going on; I can’t remember exactly what. But when I came back, I realized that the black chickie had run away, something happened to the brown one, and the three yellow ones had died because I forgot to feed them anything before I left for the big, open hall. I think I had given the brown one away, the black one ran away and the three yellow ones had died. And I’m so disappointed and so heart-broken that here I let these chickies just die because I didn’t feed them, I didn’t have a chance to feed them or get them any of that baby chick starter stuff before I went to the big, open hall thing. And that’s when I woke up. And the funny thing about this dream is that the next day we went to a garden-like place, and there was a frog right by a little map sign thing, and I used to pick up frogs all the time and put them in my pocket. But then a couple years ago I started getting really grossed out when I touched them. But this time I just picked up that frog like I used to do when I was little, and held it in my hand for a few minutes and let it go. And I was appreciating its creature-hood, if you know what I mean. And I was glad that this creature didn’t end up like the baby chicks in my dream."
950," Last night I had a really weird dream. First of all, I remember there was a lot of stuff going on and I only remember about half of it, but that’s still a lot; trust me. The first thing I can remember clearly is that I had a math class at my college with a lady professor, and she was talking to us about how math is heavenly, but it’s a cold heaven and it takes like, it keeps your mind thinking reason and logic and all that stuff. And I’m thinking, “Yeah, right, lady.” And I had this, you know how in high school they had a book which had like two and a half pages each night? Well, that’s kind of how this was, except it was like two facing pages was our assignment. And the first problem kind of read like this, “ Carl bought five milliliters of ice cream, a cone, a rong  and an equal = sign and a summation sign +  milliliters. So apparently you had to figure out how many milliliters in a cone and then add up the cone and the five and then figure out what the rong was. And then the rest of the problem was he was buying all this other food, like pizza with chicken on it and burgers with bacon, and you were supposed to know like how much it cost or how many calories it was without any other information. And I had a whole page of these to do and I was just starting to think about the first one. And next thing I knew, we were up in my relative’s home town and Mom and I were like on a vacation, and I had all these problems to do on my vacation. And I think we were at Grammy’s house first, downstairs, sort of getting settled and all. And we were waiting for Aunt Christine and Uncle Larry to come over, and Mom wanted to go up the stairs into Grammy’s attic to get like her sewing or something that was up there. And so she turned on the light on the stairwell and we went up, and then she turned on the light in that first big main room where everything is, and she started digging around, rooting around, and believe it or not, I was kind of afraid to go too far into that room, but I was afraid to go back down the stairs because she had turned off the light in the stairwell, and it was dark downstairs in the house. So I’m like sitting there, or I’m like standing there on the first step, gripping the wall post molding thing between the stairwell and the room, and focusing on the light in the room, but gripping that molding thing so tight so that I wouldn’t fall down the steps. And just waiting for her to just root around and spend all day and do do do do do do. And then I don’t remember us going down, but next thing I knew, we were in Aunt Christine’s cellar in her game room and the light was on by Bobby’s pool table. And the room was much bigger than it really is. And Christine and Larry and Uncle Bob were in that room talking about making some kind of salad for dinner, and I felt bad that we must have woke up Uncle Bob somehow because, you know, he goes to sleep really early. And I wanted to go up to Uncle Larry and say “Hi,” but I didn’t want to hang around too much and look dorky because, see, he just got the b___________ in real life, and in my dream I remembered that. And I didn’t want to act like I was too anxious to hear it. I wanted to act normal like I was anxious to see him. But I didn’t want to be too anxious, you know how that goes. And fortunately it ended on a happy note like that, and then I sort of woke up. Man, I can’t tell you what all that’s about. But I can say that we’ve been listening to Springstein lately while we’ve been doing major cleaning projects around the house. Yesterday I ran my sound system instead of having Mom run her Bose machine because hers is in her room kind of facing north, and mine has more power and it’s sort of got more force behind it and it can just face right out the open door into my bedroom where we were working. So I blasted it and the whole time I was thinking about Christine and Larry and how carefree they are up there, and how I wish we could be back up there, no matter how snowy it is still at this time of year. And I think the math has to do with that I know that there are college math classes, and that I can’t imagine myself being able to keep my sanity having one. And it was all I could do to get __________, and in this dream I was just sort of visualizing myself not being able to finish my homework and having these terrible test scores and everything I already went through in high school. And maybe it symbolizes like the stuff I’m having to go through now; I don’t know."
951,"Really not sure what was going on in this dream. I remember being in some house, and I think I was the member of some cult. Myself and this other girl were going to get married to these guys. Although I didn't want to. There was this ceremony in this room and when they called your name you were supposed to stand up. I chose not to stand up therefore I didn't have to get married, my friend did the same thing. I then remember that I was going to change my address so they wouldn't know how to locate me. My friend seemed to imply that I shouldn't do that, that it was wrong. I felt bad but did it anyway. Another part of the dream took place in the house, I was talking to some teacher about an art project. We began flying around the house, it was cool. Then I ran into someone else I knew and we starting flying together."
952,"Ok first I am in my loft. I remember looking outside and there were these guys standing on top of the building across the street. Someone mentioned they were prisoners doing community service. One of the guys was balancing on this  foot poll hopping around the street. Then I remember looking out the window to the right and there is this HUGE yellow truck sitting outside my window. Mind you I live on teh  floor  and the driver's door of this truck was at my window, that's how big it was. I stood there in amazement at the size of this truck. The I was in someone else's house. This guy named Scott and his girlfriend . We were going to have a threesome . Something came up and we all had to leave. We wind up at this hotel and go into this room. There are these  moms there and about  kids. They were all there to go to some concert. We stayed there and talked for awhile. I remember braking some screen or mirror and being worried they would find out. I also remember driving around this BEAUTIFUL city back and forth on the highway. We were all trying to figure out what city we were in. I didn't recognize it. For some reason I said Seattle, but it wasn't. It was right near a big river, and had beautiful sky scrapers and lights, etc. I remember it vividly. Then we went back to Scott's to get it on. LOL Although it never ended up happening. Not sure why. That's all I remember."
953," Last night I had a dream that the story lines of me starting off a new year of school and somebody having a wedding were so closely intertwined, it was kind of hard to make sense of it all. But I think the first scene had to do with me being at my college and going to take a more advanced electronics class there. Well, first of all, the most clearest thing in my mind is I was with this guy who kind of acted like Andrew, and he was showing me that if you constructed this little round decorative thing out of metal, and you mount it on a sort of a metal plate, that there’s holes in the metal plate that you put, that you attach a chain to. And you attach this chain and then you can chain it. And I think that he sent me to, it was Mom and I and we rode with him in this little golf cart down this path with these little Jane bready houses around it, and that was supposed to be the my college campus. And we came to the office of the man that I really wanted to talk to, but before he was there, we had some time to wait, so Mom and I kind of took off and we went to – I can’t remember where we went – but I think we went to some kind of CD store or something, some place to shop, I think. And now it gets kind of fuzzy from there. But then I remember coloring some cards. They, I can’t really explain what was on them, but you know how when I first look at a black and white thing, I can’t tell what in the heck it is until I look at little parts of it and put it together? Well, it was like, it was in the “I don’t know what the heck it is” stage, and I never put it together. I was trying to, but I could never make sense of them. I was just coloring all kinds of crazy colors . And what else?  Then we were in this store and somebody was having a wedding and they were looking at tablecloths and party supplies and pink napkins, and I was thinking, “Oh cool, if there’s some pink napkins left over, I can get them and use them as pink stuffing or something.” And we were looking at white lacy tablecloths and stuff and I think we were enjoying _______, and then sort of I faded into consciousness after that."
954," Boy, did I have a long dream last night, and I remember it so clearly too. Lately I haven’t been remembering quite this clear. I dreamt that I was back at my high school helping Mrs. Dougherty with some kind of play that they were doing. And in addition to her, they had another voice teacher, that I think was Ms. Burton. She was taller and a little chunkier, and she was wearing blue and Mrs. Dougherty was wearing black. And apparently the kids liked Ms. Burton better, but I thought she was kind of boring, and the kids liked her better because she was kind of boring. She wasn’t as vocally insightful, I guess you would say. She just went through the motions and tried to be a person. And I was helping them in the auditorium with s_______ and stuff, and I can’t really remember too good, but I was mostly just standing around. And then we had to take a bus to a portable, and the bus drove us around the campus and drove us up into the portable, and drove us around in the portable until it found a place to park. And then it was just Mrs. Dougherty’s class in this portable, and I had written two songs and she wanted me to give them to people to stand up and sing. And the one I had a written was a concept that I would rather be there to experience it, even though there was some stress. And I wasn’t given ______ anything basically, and that song was about when I was in her class in high school. And the person couldn’t really read my handwriting, so I was having to sing some of the words along with them, just so they could get through it. And then next thing I know Mom and I are walking with her out by like a bus circle. It looked like Bancroft’s bus circle, but it was still at my high school, if you could imagine that. And she was talking about like sewing and stuff, and then we got out there and Mom stops. Apparently there was an alarm box out there that had like corrosion and stuff all over it, and Mom stopped and it was like, “I told them about this. I don’t know why they’re not doing anything about it.” So she goes to the office and I’m out there with Mrs. Dougherty in the bus circle and I think Dad is there at that time, and I’m asking him, “Is the alarm going to go off?” and he won’t ask me. So I figure out what that means. And so I run through the parking lot bus area and up onto this grassy medium that’s got bushes and stuff so that I’m away from the building, and at that time I realize that I’m totally naked and I’m laying down and I’ve got a towel. I cover my head with the towel and I’m just laying there, all these bushes and stuff. And then Mom comes back and I call her over, and I tell her I need my clothes. And then I realize that there’s a hotel above the school where we’ve been staying and that’s where all my clothes are. And I find the clothes and then Dad shows up, and we’re waiting and waiting and waiting, and they make an announcement on the intercom that the alarm might go off without warning. So I’m laying there with a towel over my head and I sort of heard it, but I put my clothes on and then I lay back in that position. And then there’s a bench in front of us and they’re unpacking all kinds of yogurt and juice and stuff, and they’re picnicking out. And I sort of get less uptight because it hadn’t gone off yet and it’s been quite a while, and then I woke up."
955," Man, did I have a bizarre dream last night! Well, first of all I dreamt that I was back at my high school, kind of at like a summer school camp thing, and the transition students from the Wilcox Center were all there at this camp thing. I don’t know why I keep having dreams about being back at my high school. I just don’t get it! We were like doing a like a tour or some kind of a PE thing, and there was like this courtyard thing that we were all one. And we were like walking around the school and then coming back to the courtyard. The fire alarm system went off while we were out there, and, of course, it wasn’t too terrible because we were out in the middle of a big space between a bunch of the buildings and things. And we were already out, so there was no reason to go running in either. I don’t remember it was, whether it was just sort of a fluke or what. All the buildings it had shut off in except for the gym. The PE teacher was Alisha Wolf and she was going to take us in that gym no matter what. Yeah, it was still sounding in the gym, but she was going to take us in there anyway. And we were lining up getting ready to go in there. And you know how at my high school the Media Building and everything over in that area was like twice as bad as the other buildings. Well, the gym was like that too. And I was getting ready to skip class and run off somewhere, so I would have done anything except going into that gym while that alarm was sounding. And I couldn’t believe that the PE person was going to take us in there anyway. But as we were going in there, it just seemed to get quieter and quieter and just sort of not be a thing any more. And it must’ve just been outside or something like that. And then we were doing our thing, we were playing ball or something, I don’t remember. And then one of the girls in the transition program told me that she thought that Dad was having an affair with Charlene Oliver because she saw these pictures of them together on the internet. And that all the details about how she was attracted to him because he made her feel so special and how now she wanted to be called Eva or Gigi, and that Charlene was just sort of a middle name. And that was such a surprise! And I think there was one other person involved in this, but I can’t remember who. And then all of a sudden I was here in my house and I found this CD on the desk that like had some pictures and stuff on it. So I brought it up here and put it in my machine up here and tried to open it up, and it started acting like the Windows operating system, like the usual thing that you get, and to close in the upper right and all like that. And when I finally got to open the main part, it was like some kind of game thing. It was all these different pictures, and I was trying to copy and paste that one picture of him with Charlene Oliver onto like a blank document, and I couldn’t because it was in this game thing. And I was trying to open up the list of jpegs to that I could just grab that one, and I woke up before I could get there."
956," Last night I had kind of a dumb dream. It started off and we were going somewhere, we weren’t exactly sure where. And I think I was back at school again. Why the heck do I keep having all these dreams about being back at school? I don’t remember too much right now, but let’s hold off and maybe sometime later in the day I will. Now I remember some. I think it was about somebody saying something about being totally irresponsible. I can’t remember what the situation was, but I think it – oh, I know what it was. Something about putting so much food at the top of the refrigerator and it blocks the light at the bottom on Jack’s sandwich and then wouldn’t we give him enough consideration to at least let the fridge light be on his sandwich. And that was something that Dad was saying. And this dream is full of bits and pieces of nonsense. And I think another thing was – let’s see her now – oh, there was this picture, there was this still picture of one of these American Idols standing on stage. I think it was like a freeze-the-tape shot, if you know what I mean. Somebody was saying something about that it was going to start up a second time this year, but it was going to be a lot sloppier and a lot goofier. And I’m trying to think, there’s something else. Something about a machine that wasn’t really adjusted right, and you had to do something really weird in order to adjust it. That’s about all."
957," Last night I had the most bizarre dream. Well, first of all, let me try to explain this. I dreamt that I was staying at this hotel because I was going to a place where I had to be by myself. But it was kind of a weird hotel in that I think the way it worked was you had to exchange your bags at just a certain time, and it was something scary like you had to do a math problem in order to get them back. And I remember being kind of lost, and it was really, really late. It was like after dark, and I was outside, and I was trying to get back to this hotel. And then once I got into the hotel, I didn’t know where my room was. It was just kind of all mixed up jumble of mish-mash, I don’t remember. But these scenes were totally incongruent. Next thing I knew I was with this girl, and Dad I think, and I had the bird and the bird wasn’t just a live bird; he was part live and part mechanical. He had this mechanical thing in him where he would start saying crazy things, and I think there was something about, “new bells, cockle shells,” but I don’t remember where it came in. I just know that it came in somewhere. I know there was more, and I’m missing half the pieces, but lately I’ve been really bad about not remembering my dreams that well. Now obviously some of this came from the convention, and yeah, it was a big hotel and yeah, I had to be by myself, but I didn’t feel alone at the convention because there were so many other people, period, and people I could feel like were friends, and people that were visually impaired and knowing that they were here for the first time too. And I wanted to learn from them how they were going to function, so I didn’t feel alone. But in my dream I felt terribly alone. And the thing about exchanging our bags all over the place, I don’t know exactly where that came in, but I do know there was this guy with us that liked “Mash,” but I was never scared of losing my bags or scared of something taking them. And I don’t know, it was a mish-mash."
958," These are two dreams that I had while I was staying up at the springs, but I didn’t have this tape with me so I couldn’t remember them then, so I’m recording them now. The first night I dreamt, I had kind of a screwy dream about a fire truck again. I keep having dreams on and off about fire trucks with the scary back-up alarm sound, and it’s got to be kind of a dream symbol and I’ve got to figure out what it means. But anyway, I dreamt that I was going to help out the fire station with some kind of carnival or something. I don’t remember having to deal with the Peavey system, but I was running around like putting tables up and stuff, and I had my cell phone on. The thing of it was, whenever anybody would call me on the cell phone, instead of answering the phone, I had to jump on the, you know, like hold onto the side of one of the trucks and let them drive off on a call with me. And we didn’t only go on a call, we just sort of went around the block and came back. That was kind of stupid! But I had a partner who was going to drive, like a man, like you know how they do. And Dad was there and I had a feeling he was like directing the events. He wasn’t really going on any calls, but he was like an active lieutenant for the day. And when we’d jump on the side of the truck, the truck had two vacuum cleaner hose like type things hanging off the back of it dragging in the street. And you know how back-up alarm goes “Doo doo, doo doo,” well, the one hose would make the high “Doo” sound and the other hose would make the “doo.”  And now that I think about it, it’s the funniest thing. It would be going down the road like that. And it would do that sound when we were going forward, and we wouldn’t back up, we’d just go forward and it would make that sound. And I know there was something more. Oh, in my dream it kind of scared me and I was dreading, dreading, dreading having to go on that. And so whenever I would get a call on my cell phone, I would think, “Oh no, oh no, I’ve got to go do this.” And that was that. "
959,I dreamed that I was sneaking around the boys' dorms because I was on this top-secret mission. All I remember was that it was all very funny!
960," The next night I had a little nicer dream. I dreamt that I was babysitting a kid named Joey, and I think it came from a Joey that Mom used to babysit. But this Joey was a toddler, and he had like two other kids running around and they were girls. And they had a keyboard in their room. It was a few more octaves than the Music Major, but it was kind of similar. And it came with these little figures of girls with instruments that you had to stand on the, you know, the top ledge above where the keys are. And they were just little things that came with it, and they each had a story. You know, the plastic like the Easter rabbit that comes on top of those candy things? Well, it was kind of like that. There was a tall, slender – and these were about  or ” high – there was a tall, slender Caucasian woman in a pink dress, like a prom dress, with a flute. And then there was a short, kind of fat black girl with a trumpet. And there was sort of a brownish gray in-between person with some kind of harp thing. And there was somebody else with a French horn that was like a little boy. And they had a storybook that went along, and as you read the story, you were supposed to play the part of each character and you were supposed to change the keyboard to their particular instrument sound. And the kids and I were trying to do this. It was kind of funny, but the kids and I were trying to do this, and I don’t remember if we ever got through it, but it was something along, “Here comes Letty; she’s ready to see her.” And then “doot, do, doot, do, do” and “Now, here comes the other one. She’s a little more shy, doot, do, doot, do, do,” or something like that. And I don’t remember anything more."
961,"I dreamed that someone was trying to kill my father. I tried to stop the person, and they killed me instead. I just remember seeing the end of the gun and hearing the shot, and then I woke up so scared."
962," Last night I had a dream that wasn’t really so odd, but was sort of normal, as a matter of fact. I dreamt that my mom and I were going to go to some park that we don’t usually go to, and we were going to take the boom box and we were going to go by ourselves. And we were going to take some Pringles and some root beer and some fun snacks. And we were just going to go there and munch out and relax and just have fun. We were supposed to leave the house at : so that it would give us an hour and a half to be over there before she has to come home and fix supper. Well, she was dawdling – and diddling and dawdling, and diddling and dawdling, and we weren’t even close to getting out of the house until like :. And I said, “Listen, we took up all our time. What’s the use of us going now?” And all the stuff was out in the front yard by the bike, and the chips and everything was out there, and the boom box had turned into a small, little dinky, teeny portable unit. And I was bringing it inside, and I came in the front door and Dad was standing right there on the front porch and said, “Well, hello, Jess!” I just sort of put it down in a corner and was really embarrassed. And this is the craziest part: there was like a bench in our front yard that was blue and it had like, you know, the plastic diamond things that, you know, benches have. And I was getting really, really hot and bothered on that bench about something, and I bent over the back of it and I had the notion that somebody saw me. And I’m trying to think what else happened. Oh, then we were inside again, and Sheryl, Sandra and Sam were there, and we were giving Dad a Father’s Day present, but there was a wedding card that I made that was just of a couple, a bride and a groom, but when you opened up the card, it said something really gross inside – I don’t remember what. But Sheryl gave that card to Dad and I snatched it away from him because I said, “That’s not a Father’s Day card; that’s supposed to be for somebody else and that’s for something else.” And then I think I woke up."
963," Last night I had a kind of a usual dream. I dreamt that I was going in a van with some other people we knew and Mom to this ranch, and this ranch had horses on it. And there was this lady named Greta that was kind of acting like Aunt Christine. Come to think of it, I think Aunt Christine was with us and this lady she ______ Greta, and a kid named Travis, and some guy and Mom and I. And this ranch was, first of all, in this van the seatbelt was really, really hard to snap together, and it was sort of a big and roomy van, but it was sort of like a, not really that nice to ride in. And this ranch had horses, and I had the notion that they had lots of stuff they were going to do there, but they were not going to let me stay there by myself because somebody licensed has to be with the horses at all times. And you had to be a licensed driver to be able to take care of these horses. And that was kind of weird, but I felt sort of inferior because I’m not a licensed driver, but what does being a licensed driver have to do with being able to take care of them? And they were, they just seemed like kind of prissy people that didn’t belong in the country, if you know what I mean. And I think this deals with deeper issues in that riding a horse isn’t necessarily like driving, but people like to box people in, and I think I’ve been feeling some of the red tape that I’m having to cut through in life and that’s what this dream is all about."
964,"I was in my house and we were going on a trip somewhere. I remember that I was getting ready to leave and the phone rang. It was my cousin Brian. He called to give me the address and phone number of my cousin Mark. At the same time my friend was downstairs yelling at me to hurry or we would miss your ride to the airport. So I was very frantic and Brian was taking his time telling me the address. I repeated it back to him, something like  Market Street. Then he did the phone number and I couldn't understand what he was saying. I was extremely frustrated that this point and just told him not to worry about it and that I had to go. I run downstairs to meet my friend and then I wake up. I went back to sleep and the dream picked up. We were on a plane and we were about to land. As we approached the runway we were expecting the plane to touch down but it didn't. I guess it finally did but we didn't feel it. Now the plane is no longer a plane it's some room. We are all told we can go eat dinner, off to the right of the room is a Beauty Salon and we could get our hair done there. I wanted to get mine cut & colored but I didn't think I would have time, so I contemplated just getting it cut. Then I saw Marcus standing by himself and walked up to him. He had gotten his hair done. It was long on top, short in the back, the top was blonde and underneath was darker. He seemed sad, I gave him a hug and we talked for a bit. That's all I remember."
965,"I had a dream that dreams were a fashion accessory, so every morning when someone woke up, he or she would ""wear"" his or her dream, and that would be some sort of fashion statement. Then I had a dream that the whole school lived in Granddaddy's house. I was trying to find the hammock outside, but it was so dark that it pressed in on my eyeballs. And then I woke up."
966,"I dreamed that I was in Bundy as a proctor, and all the girls on my floor were always late to check-in."
967," Last night I dreamt that I was checking in to a big hotel with a group of four or five other people my age. And we weren’t really going to stay there for the night, but we were going for a late banquet dinner thing. And I can’t remember if it was NSC or ABWA, but it was one of those places. And I was supposed to give a speech to this group of people at a banquet, and I was already late, and I was going with a black boy, two white boys and another girl, I think. And we were, they sort of thought they knew way to our rooms, and I think one or two of them had white canes. And they just sort of were showing me the way to get to there, and they were, “Maybe it’s this one,” open the door and it’s dark, “No, not in there.” “Maybe it’s this one. All these doors are locked.” And we went up an escalator and we climbed up a couple stairs and through a little gift shop thing and we were kind of in the wrong place. We weren’t supposed to go up that way. And then we went down an escalator that was really, really, really, really tall and sort of had turns like regular stairs do and little landings. And I grabbed the railing and we just sailed down that escalator. It went so fast. And then we ran back to the desk because then we were really late. And the desk person, I think I said, “We’re trying to find a big convention room. Where is the banquet going to be for them?” And they said, “Oh, that’s in Building .” And the thought sunk in that this hotel has sixteen buildings and this was only Building #, and I was thinking how it sure would be nice of them to get us a carry guy to get a golf cart and take us right to the place we need to be. But they seemed to let us alone and just let us do our thing. We started out the front door and down the sidewalk, and then I woke up."
968,"I dreamed that I had to take the AP US History exam, even though I hadn't taken the class. I also forgot all my pens and pencils and freaked out when I got to the exam. I asked if I could go home and change, but I wasn't allowed to. I left anyway and went down to the lake to take a break before I had to take the exam. On my way back up the hill, I couldn't move. Everyone around me was walking up the hill, and I became really mad because I thought I was going to miss the exam. I guess I was rooming with Victoria, because she was there too. I never made it to the AP, so I had to take it online during the summer. Then I had this power that I could make people fall in love with whomever they wanted. And then I woke up."
969," I had a dream that had a couple of different scenes to it, but the one – this is like the afternoon now – but the one that stuck in my head the most is the weirdest. I was making a dinosaur cookie and I was frosting it with bright green frosting, and I was putting some brown on the dinosaur’s feet and kind of swirling a little brown up near his back and even his really beady eyes. And I guess he looked pretty mean because Dad was standing there and saying, “Now what kind of impression do you think this is going to give people? People are going to think that you have an attraction to violence, and you may be a suspect of something, and you may be arrested, and you may lose everything in a moment.” And I was thinking, “Oh yeah, over a dinosaur cookie.” But that was kind of, I don’t know. There was more to it; I don’t remember though. This is what I get for waiting."
970,"Last night I had a horrible dream that the more I loved my high school, the more everyone would smoke. There was this huge dinner for all my friends and teachers, but they were all getting stoned, and I couldn't find out how to make them stop. Then I was in a play that went really poorly, but I can't remember the details."
971," Two nights ago I had a dream that Grammy on my mother’s side, who has since deceased, was going to sleep on a blanket in my studio. She was laying like against the wall with her back to me, facing my desk and all my CD cases and stuff, and I was covering her up so that she wouldn’t be cold in the night, because it was the dead heat of summer and we had the air conditioner on. And she was just snoring away, in the loud way she usually snored. And I think Mom and I were singing to her or something. But I thought it was kind of odd, I guess, in that thinking about how their family up there is so much different from this family here. Tonight, last night I had a dream that Mom and I were going to see Brian Adams at a small place like a restaurant, and it was sort of an intimate concert thing. And we were going there on the bike, and Sheryl, Sandra and Sam and Jack and Polly were supposed to meet us because we had a bunch of tickets. And we were already starting to get there late, and we were like walking the tandem bike across  Avenue, and I was telling her, “The least you can do is get me to a concert on time, you know.” And then we got back on and rode the rest of the way, and we went in the concert and it was just about starting, and they started with, “Everything I Do I Do For You.” By the time we got in, they were doing a bunch of songs I didn’t even know, and I was thinking how this concert was going to be recorded, so I tapped the level down nine or ten notches on the mini disc recorder so with all the booming and banging it wouldn’t make it clip over. And Mom went outside and called the people on the cell phone to tell them that  Street was closed,  Street was closed, and  Street was closed because they were doing some massive construction. And at the concert they were like, the band was sitting up there with a blue background, and for, I saw for whatever reason, I was doing like some really sick stuff in front of everybody and trying not to make it obvious. But it was such a habit. And I don’t remember too much more. Oh, I know, the concert and all the sound and stuff evolved into just something in our bedroom that was playing on a little boom box, and then I woke up."
972,"Last night I had a dream that I was underground in some sewer. I was hiding from these assassins. I went home and had to go to class, but I couldn't find anything to wear, honestly. So I had to cut up some of my mother's clothes to wear. When I went to school, I had to make a salad as a test. There was a dressing that would sting you if you poured it wrong. I couldn't remember which dressing it was, but I wasn't supposed to ask, since it was the secret of the test. Pauline was in line inside and I tried asking secretly which one it was, but then I got yelled at!"
973,I dreamed that I lived on the  floor of Bundy and I lived with a new Asian girl. We met for hockey practice every day. She was nice. We had trouble storing all our stuff though.
974," Last night I had a dream that was kind of out of the ordinary, but it wasn’t too crazy. I dreamt that, first of all, I was trying to access the USC website over the internet, and it was apparently by taking some courses from USC because I was trying to figure out what some course material was and what kind of books I was going to need or something, or what the teacher was going to be doing the next thing, or something like that. And I was having a s_____ read different prompts and things, just, you know, like in zoom text except it wasn’t really magnified all over the place. I had a real simple screen that I was working from, and the synthesizer was reading a lot of the stuff. And I had to adjust the rate so that it would read slower, and I couldn’t, and then I sort of figured out how. And I think Mom was working with me on this one, and she was telling me that you could access the whole thing from a cell phone, and I didn’t believe it. It was too whacked out. But then, the next little scene is the part that I remember the best. I was at this ba____ like place, it was like a trailer area but it sort of had more of a farm to it. There were vehicles and things around and there were cages of, most of the cages were empty, but there was this one cage that was sort of covered in the front that had big bars and they were wide apart. And they had geese in it, there were about seven or eight geese in a cage about the size of the chicken cage, and they were all jammed in there. And most of them were grown. But there was this one black goose that was real, real thin and light compared to the others, and I had a feeling that she wasn’t really eating. She sort of quacked like a female duck, but she had a long neck and a big body like a goose. And she ducked her head and was able to scoot through the bars of the cage, and I put her down on the ground and she was following me up the road to this house. And she kind of got tired and I picked her up and carried her. And she just had a real sorry sound to her, and I had the feeling she hadn’t been eating very well. And I told the lady who runs this place, I showed her this black goose and I said, “I don’t think she’s been eating that well. Look at her. And the lady grabbed her from my arms and said to the bird, “What do you think you’re doing?” basically yelling at the bird for getting out of the cage. And I said, I snatched her back and I said, “That’s not the point. What I’m trying to get you to understand, Lady, is that she hasn’t been eating very well. You have to give her something.” And just about that time the bird left a big plop of poop running down my leg, and then I woke up."
975," Last night I had a crazy dream. I dreamt that I was back at my high school again, except this time I was with Astrid and Darlene, and I was there like a couple hours after school had left out for some odd reason. And I was there with my mobility instructor, Mr. Heffler, and they were doing some construction on the stairs and in order to actually get down the stairs, they had the stairwell part blocked off, and they had some like loose boards. You had to undo one of the loose boards and climb down a little step ladder makeshift thing to actually get down to the lower level. And the elevator was, it kind of worked sometimes and it didn’t work other times, and we didn’t want to take a risk. And I think me and Darlene were on the elevator one time, and the building had like five or six floors for some odd reason, and for whatever reason the elevator wouldn’t stop at whatever floor we wanted. And I think this dream was a big hodgepodge mish-mash of all different stuff, and I think after I got my business done, I was like wandering around in this school building that was my high school, and it was all in shambles, and it was supposedly that way because they were doing construction. And I mentioned about the stairwell being blocked off and there was just stuff laying around all over everywhere. And it was real precarious. And Darlene and I had a cab to catch. I don’t know what business we had to do over at the school, but after we finished our business we had a cab to catch at :, I think. And it was real gray and rainy outside and we were making our way back to the cab circle because that’s where the cab was going to pick us up. And I don’t remember if I ever made it or not. I don’t remember too much. This was kind of a dumb dream."
976," I dreamt that Sheryl and Sandra and Sam and Ms. Fletcher and Elizabeth and some of her family were all sort of in the house and milling around and stuff. And we were all going to pile into our car and go somewhere. And we were waiting and waiting for some people to get some stuff ready. I think Mom and somebody else were still getting ready, and Dad was standing at the door like, “Okay, I’m ready whenever you are.” And I was sitting on the porch swing, and Sam gets out of the car and comes up to the porch and comes in the door and closes it. And this is just unfolding like ______ just I guess so we can look at it, but I think he’s like cocking a gun or something, and then he went back out the door, and he got a chain saw and I saw he was going to bring it in the house. And he’s revving it up and stuff out front there, and I thought he was going to bring it into the house. And so I ran through the house, and for some reason our house was a little bigger. And then different things kept stopping us. I think I might have been riding with Elizabeth a little bit, but I can’t remember if we actually went where we were going. We were planning a wedding for me. Apparently Grandpa had given me some wedding rings and we had to just find me a person to go through the ceremony with just to show him that I got married with his rings, and we weren’t actually going to legally do it, I don’t think. And I can’t remember who it was going to be, but we were getting all this stuff ready. And people were just like dawdling majorly because there were so many things, and I was outside getting some different stuff. And there was a brown and a white baby chick, and I would catch one of them and take it to the side of the house and put it in a cage, and then I’d go up for the other one. And when I was catching these chickies, I was sort of thinking how I’ve got to bring them in here so they won’t run too far and so the truck won’t back over them. And there was also a brown and a white grown chicken that I was catching and putting by the side of the house because I didn’t want them in the cage so they would peck the babies. And I was sort of devising some kind of little fence to keep them by the side of the house. And then I was doing a bunch of other stuff in the yard, but I can’t remember what. And then I was coming in the house and saying, “Okay, everybody, are you all ready finally?” And they were saying, “Well, we’re going to come out there to you.” And they were saying something like, “I’d better go talk to Grandpa because I don’t know if he wants you to have his rings or if he wants you to have my rings.” And then I woke up. I know there were more elements to it, but I can’t possibly remember them all. I think there was some kind of orange blower thing involved somewhere, but I can’t remember what."

We were on a train somewhere, a really huge train, like the size of a mall. I somehow knew the train was going to be hijacked, so we got off at Ed's house. There, I made plans for us to get picked up. When I went to get out of bed , I discovered that I was naked. I found some way to trick Ed into not looking at me while I ran away. I found a pay phone, but I needed  quarters to make a call.

I guess he needed me to fix his shirt collar or trim his hair, because all of a sudden we were alone in the corner. I kissed Orlando. After that, he kept chasing me everywhere. Then I had another dream that I was hanging out with Jackson, just walking around and messing around and kissing, but then I looked at my watch and realized it was almost midnight. I had forgotten my curfew. I tried to take a train home and my father told me I should have been home earlier because I had to babysit that night.

I went back over and I went inside and he had killed the ice cream man and I was like, “What the hell did you do?” He was like “See, I caught him for you, no more chasing him.” So I ran home but went back the next day and he was in a hospitable bed and I was like, “What’s wrong?” And he was like, “I'm dying,” so I said, “Oh my god, really?!” He said, “No, I just want to do you,” and I said, “Umm, let’s just make out” and then ran back home and never came back."

985," Last night I had sort of an involved dream, and actually it wasn’t all that whacky. But I don’t exactly know what to make of it just yet. I dreamt that it was close to my birthday and we were having some kind of garage sale or something, and there was like three or four keyboards out on the front sidewalk. One was kind of small and the other three were really big, and somebody was saying I should try them out and see what the sound sounded like, see how real they sounded. And I don’t think Mom or Dad were there. I think this was like a big, it was either a garage sale or a party; I couldn’t figure out which. But they were inside, busy as anything, and there were people everywhere. And so I put the smallest one on a little table out front, and there was a whole bunch of chaos and confusion, so I had to really listen and tell if it sounded normal or not. And it didn’t really. It was kind of funny and kind of weird. And then, so I put it back on the sidewalk where it was with the others, and a bunch of other boxes of clothes and toys and things. And I went inside and Mom was making me a birthday cake that was supposed to look like that, either that or a mixer; I couldn’t figure out which. But she started frosting it with chocolate frosting, and dabbing some white here and there. And next thing I know, the very front of the cake was crumbling off, and I could see that inside it was a yellow cake. And then some more of the sides crumbled off, and this cake was just getting smaller and smaller and messier and messier. And I don’t remember too much about that little scene. But the next little scene was that Mom and Dad were out of town and the house was totally empty, and I was having Angeline and one of her friends over. Now Angeline is a Jehovah’s Witness that’s been coming around and, you know, sort of preaching once a week. And I was going to serve them Cheerios and something else, Cheerios and tea, I think, for lunch. And I had a little gold card from them that said something other than “Happy Birthday,” but I sort of knew it was for my birthday. And I didn’t want to tell them too much about what I did for my birthday because they don’t celebrate birthdays and they would frown upon it. But I served them Cheerios, and they said that, they called them rings of cereal. One of the girls said that she did like rings of cereal, but without any fat or any sugar or anything in them. And I can’t remember, but they just sat there kind of prissy, and I think I woke up."

He was doing some dance about this one burnt hamburger. Kylie was there and she wanted me to go see a movie with her, but I told her I was jetlagged and about to fall asleep any minute. She said it was OK because she was working at The Old New Yorker, which was some sort of antique store of New Yorker magazines. Then Alexis and Sra. Perez wanted me to go shopping with them at this huge Victoria's Secret. But I remembered that I had just gone, so I told them no. Finally, Tyler was wearing a green polo shirt, and we were running around trying to hide from these guys who were chasing us. We kept diving into different communal beds at the refuge. We couldn't get away so we went to this Christmas store where they were taking pictures. We thought we would blend in because Tyler was wearing green, and it was Christmas. When we got there, I realized that Santa was missing from all the pictures, so I ran to the bathroom where he was apparently being held hostage. I saved him just in time. Then Tyler told me I was perfect and I kissed him! Then we ran away and I woke up."
991," Last night I had a kind of string of various dreams. But the one that was kind of the most important was that I was at some man’s house, I think it was for some kind of a reception thing. And I don’t even remember what we were supposed to talk about, but I was helping him set up a sound system and stuff. And we were in his like porch veranda thing, and he had this trellis-like type thing that had shelves and plants and stuff. And we were rigging up all these wires to go around it, and I stuck a lavaliere mikeup there and ran the wire around and dropped another _____ down from something. And I think we might have even set up some Christmas lights. And I don’t remember who he was or why I was there, or what else I was setting up, and I just had it a minute ago. I shouldn’t have gone to the bathroom before I started recording this. But another little scene thing that was before that, that’s really clear in my mind, that I dreamt that Dad found out what a teetsy  thing is, which really that was something unreal from back in the day when I was real little, that was like a guitar-shaped, light-up flashlight thing that would play the end of “Have You Seen Her” and stuff. It was sort of a synesthetic  response to the sound that I heard. Well, fast forward ‘til now. I dreamt that Dad thought that it was something that you would have to connect to the phone line in order to use, and that it would make your phone bill go real high if you did anything on it. And some boy had it, I think. And I was pretty upset and a little afraid because I was under the impression that it wasn’t real, and here he’s talking like it was real. And I tried to tell him it isn’t real, but he said, “Well, I saw somebody that had one, so it is real.” And I was terrified. And then I, in my dream I went downstairs after being, I don’t know, up here, and Mom and Dad were watching TV and I kissed Mom good night and I whispered in her ear that she should come up when she can. And I think in my dream we stood around talking, but I don’t remember what about. Then I woke up.."

993,"I dreamed that Jay was trying to get me drunk, but he was really sick. I brought him home. I was afraid my mother and father would be mad that I had brought a boy home, but they weren't since I was just trying to help him. They brought me on a trip and we had to wait in the airport for a long time before we traveled somewhere on the beach. I walked by Jay and he was so white. I was embarrassed in my bikini.

995,"Last night I dreamed I was cross-country skiing to Gavin and Pete's room in Taylor. They were sharing a room, I guess, and I had to get bandages for someone. I thought it was ok to leave the dorm after check-in since I was trying to help someone else. Mrs. Crank was prowling Taylor and caught me hiding under Pete's bed. Although I thought it was OK, I still felt like I was doing something wrong. So then I was sent home for breaking check-in, and my father got really mad at me and lecture me in front of the whole boys' varsity hockey team. I was really embarrassed. Then I was at the refuge in the mountains with him and the boys' hockey team. A bus stopped and Lou got out. His footsteps made so much noise because he had gotten fat over the summer. Then my father was reading an updated version of The Great Gatsby, which was actually about Lou and me, and everything worked out in the end, and no one died. My favorite passage about their first kiss and the tuning fork , had been rewritten about LOU giving me this look and me crying because he was convinced that he didn't like me. But then we got together in the end. That night I had to clean up the refuge for dinner. I began sweeping and mopping and Sophia got mad at me because she thought she had cleaned earlier, and that I was only cleaning because I thought she had done a bad job. So she got really pissed off. That night there was a big winter carnival with all sorts of sports games going on. Caroline wanted me to come watch her swim meet, but I wanted to watch the boys' hockey game. I went and remembered seeing Lou skate out onto the ice. I guess I started a new dream, because I was all of a sudden drafted for some war against England. My canon was stuck and I was so terrified. Then I got shot in the leg. I somehow ran to a boat collecting people, and Lou was there too for Christ's sake. We ended up in the Bermuda Triangle, where we got lost. The compass pointed north no matter we turned, so we had no idea how to get anywhere. We ended up pretending we were Peter Pan and Captain Hook fighting, and then I woke up."
996," Last night I had a dream that I was going to stay over at Astrid’s friend’s house. There was Astrid and there was another girl that was like Astrid. And first of all, before any of that, I dreamt that I was making kind of a sculpture out of something I broke, and I was using really strong glue. And I put like a dinosaur head on the front of like a porcelain rock, and then I put a little tail on the side of it. I put a couple other things on it, and then this was going to sit on a bicycle. And I think it was really raining and really lightning and thundering and I couldn’t really go with the girls to their house until it was done. But they were sitting on the porch swing with me, and Mom came home from a shopping trip and she was unloading groceries in the kitchen. And she was complaining about how the store wouldn’t cash her out and she had to wait and wait because if the power goes out at the store, then they can’t use their register. What else? I think somehow we got over to the girl’s house and Astrid and the girl were going to build something. They had like shop tools out and like saws and sanders and vacuum cleaners. And I think in my dream Astrid had a little bit of vision, about like mine, and the girl had a little bit more than I do. And I was peeking in the dark in the bedroom for a hair clip to tie up my hair and then I woke up."

999," Obviously it’s a rainy day. Last night I had kind of a strange dream before huge claps of thunder woke me up, and I must’ve been hearing rain in my dream because it played into my dream in a funny way. I dreamt that our house was just a little bigger than it is, and our living room was huge and kind of intersected with our porch in a way. There wasn’t that wall there. And Mom was sleeping out in the living room with some big pillows and Dad was like, “Are you sleeping out here because the roof’s leaking in the bedroom?” And Mom was like, “No, I’m just sleeping out here because there’s such a nice breeze, so I really appreciate it.” And then we found out that the roof was leaking in the bedroom and he got so mad that she wouldn’t tell him. But instead of roof in my dream, they were talking about the fact that the door was leaking. I don’t know why. And let’s see; what else? Then after that I was walking around the house getting some stuff out of the kitchen and stuff, and this naked man with a guide dog was going through the house. And I had never seen him before. And I got the impression like he was staying with us or something. And his dog was black, and his shoulders came up to my chest, like a little bigger than they usually are, and was like sniffing me. And the guy was saying, “Come on. Come on.” And he just kept walking through our house for some reason. And I was supposed to go down in the cellar to get our party mix that I was going to take to the party today, but they only had this little tiny, little bitty light bulb up in the ceiling of the cellar and it wasn’t making much light at all and it was real dark outside. And I told Mom, “I’m not going to go down there unless you change the bulb and make it its full brightness.” And I don’t think I ever did get down there to get my cereal, I don’t know, but I was real glad that all of this was a dream."
